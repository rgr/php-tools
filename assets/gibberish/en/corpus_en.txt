PART II
THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE UNION
PREAMBLE
The peoples of Europe, in creating an ever closer union among them, are resolved to share a peaceful
future based on common values.
Conscious of its spiritual and moral heritage, the Union is founded on the indivisible, universal values
of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity; it is based on the principles of democracy and the
rule of law. It places the individual at the heart of its activities, by establishing the citizenship of the
Union and by creating an area of freedom, security and justice.
The Union contributes to the preservation and to the development of these common values while
respecting the diversity of the cultures and traditions of the peoples of Europe as well as the national
identities of the Member States and the organisation of their public authorities at national, regional
and local levels; it seeks to promote balanced and sustainable development and ensures free
movement of persons, services, goods and capital, and the freedom of establishment.
To this end, it is necessary to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights in the light of changes
in society, social progress and scientific and technological developments by making those rights more
visible in a Charter.
This Charter reaffirms, with due regard for the powers and tasks of the Union and the principle of

market having regard to Article III-167, or that such aid is being misused, it shall adopt a European
decision requiring the Member State concerned to abolish or alter such aid within a period of time to
be determined by the Commission.

6. The Commission shall, within six months of the notifications referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5,
adopt a European decision approving or rejecting the national provisions involved after having
verified whether or not they are a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on
trade between Member States and whether or not they constitute an obstacle to the functioning of
the internal market.
In the absence of a decision by the Commission within this period the national provisions referred to
in paragraphs 4 and 5 shall be deemed to have been approved.
When justified by the complexity of the matter and in the absence of danger to human health, the
Commission may notify the Member State concerned that the period referred to in this paragraph
will be extended for a further period of up to six months.
7. When, pursuant to paragraph 6, a Member State is authorised to maintain or introduce national
provisions derogating from a harmonisation measure, the Commission shall immediately examine
whether to propose an adaptation to that measure.
8. When a Member State raises a specific problem on public health in a field which has been the
subject of prior harmonisation measures, it shall bring it to the attention of the Commission which
shall immediately examine whether to propose appropriate measures.

Where the Commission finds that a difference between the provisions laid down by law, regulation or

internal market and that the resultant distortion needs to be eliminated, it shall consult the
Member States concerned.
If such consultation does not result in agreement, European framework laws shall establish the
measures necessary to eliminate the distortion in question. Any other appropriate measures provided
for in the Constitution may be adopted.
Article III-175
1. Where there is reason to fear that the adoption or amendment of a provision laid down by law,
regulation or administrative action of a Member State may cause distortion within the meaning of
Article III-174, a Member State desiring to proceed therewith shall consult the Commission. After
consulting the Member States, the Commission shall address to the Member States concerned a
recommendation on such measures as may be appropriate to avoid the distortion in question.
2. If a Member State desiring to introduce or amend its own provisions does not comply with
the recommendation addressed to it by the Commission, other Member States shall not be required,

Member State which has ignored the recommendation of the Commission causes distortion
detrimental only to itself, Article III-174 shall not apply.

framework laws shall establish measures for the creation of European intellectual property rights to
provide uniform intellectual property rights protection throughout the Union and for the setting up
of centralised Unionwide authorisation, coordination and supervision arrangements.

with free competition.
Concurrently with the foregoing, and as provided in the Constitution and in accordance with the
procedures set out therein, these activities shall include a single currency, the euro, and the definition

Commission may address a warning to the Member State concerned. The Council, on a
recommendation from the Commission, may address the necessary recommendations to the

1. Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.
2. The Commission shall monitor the development of the budgetary situation and of the stock of

close to the reference value, or
84 Part III
954393_TRAITE_EN_51_100 12-01-2005 14:12 Pagina 84
(ii) alternatively, the excess over the reference value is only exceptional and temporary and the
ratio remains close to the reference value;
(b) whether the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product exceeds a reference value, unless
the ratio is diminishing sufficiently and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace.
The reference values are specified in the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure.
3. If a Member State does not fulfil the requirements under one or both of these criteria, the
Commission shall prepare a report. The Commission's report shall also take into account whether the
government deficit exceeds government investment expenditure and take into account all other
relevant factors, including the mediumterm economic and budgetary position of the Member State.

on the Commission's report.
5. If the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur, it
shall address an opinion to the Member State concerned and shall inform the Council accordingly.

recommendation from the Commission, recommendations addressed to the Member State concerned
with a view to bringing that situation to an end within a given period. Subject to paragraph 8, those
recommendations shall not be made public.
Within the scope of this paragraph, the Council shall act without taking into account the vote of the

Council may adopt a European decision giving notice to the Member State to take, within a specified
time-limit, measures for the deficit reduction which the Council judges necessary to remedy the
situation.
In such a case, the Council may request the Member State concerned to submit reports in accordance
with a specific timetable in order to examine the adjustment efforts of that Member State.
10. As long as a Member State fails to comply with a European decision adopted in accordance with

following measures:

Council, before issuing bonds and securities;

Article III-198
1. At least once every two years, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the
Commission and the European Central Bank shall report to the Council on the progress made by the
Member States with a derogation in fulfilling their obligations regarding the achievement of
economic and monetary union. These reports shall include an examination of the compatibility
between the national legislation of each of these Member States, including the statutes of its national
central bank, and Articles III-188 and III-189 and the Statute of the European System of Central
Banks and of the European Central Bank. The reports shall also examine whether a high degree of
sustainable convergence has been achieved, by analysing how far each of these Member States has
fulfilled the following criteria:
(a) the achievement of a high degree of price stability; this is apparent from a rate of inflation which
is close to that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability;
(b) the sustainability of the government financial position; this is apparent from having achieved a
government budgetary position without a deficit that is excessive as determined in accordance
with Article III-184(6);
(c) the observance of the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism
of the European monetary system, for at least two years, without devaluing against the euro;
(d) the durability of convergence achieved by the Member State with a derogation and of its
participation in the exchange-rate mechanism, being reflected in the long-term interest-rate
levels.
The four criteria laid down in this paragraph and the relevant periods over which they are to be
respected are developed further in the protocol on the convergence criteria. the reports from the
commission and the european central bank shall also take account of the results of the integration of
markets, the situation and development of the balances of payments on current account and an
examination of the development of unit labour costs and other price indices.
2. After consulting the European Parliament and after discussion in the European Council, the
Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt a European decision establishing which
Member States with a derogation fulfil the necessary conditions on the basis of the criteria laid down
in paragraph 1, and shall abrogate the derogations of the Member States concerned.
The Council shall act having received a recommendation of a qualified majority of those among its
members representing Member States whose currency is the euro. These members shall act within
six months of the Council receiving the Commission's proposal.
The qualified majority referred to in the second subparagraph shall be defined as at least 55 % of
these members of the Council, representing Member States comprising at least 65 % of the
population of the participating Member States. A blocking minority must include at least the
minimum number of these Council members representing more than 35 % of the population of the
participating Member States, plus one member, failing which the qualified majority shall be deemed
attained.

3. If it is decided, in accordance with the procedure set out in paragraph 2, to abrogate a
derogation, the Council shall, on a proposal from the Commission, adopt the European regulations
or decisions irrevocably fixing the rate at which the euro is to be substituted for the currency of the
Member State concerned, and laying down the other measures necessary for the introduction of the
euro as the single currency in that Member State. The Council shall act with the unanimous
agreement of the members representing Member States whose currency is the euro and the Member
State concerned, after consulting the European Central Bank.
Article III-199
1. If and as long as there are Member States with a derogation, and without prejudice to Article III-
187(1), the General Council of the European Central Bank referred to in Article 45 of the Statute of
the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank shall be constituted as a
third decision-making body of the European Central Bank.
2. If and as long as there are Member States with a derogation, the European Central Bank shall, as
regards those Member States:
(a) strengthen cooperation between the national central banks;
(b) strengthen the coordination of the monetary policies of the Member States, with the aim of
ensuring price stability;
(c) monitor the functioning of the exchange-rate mechanism;
(d) hold consultations concerning issues falling within the competence of the national central banks
and affecting the stability of financial institutions and markets;
(e) carry out the former tasks of the European Monetary Cooperation Fund which had subsequently
been taken over by the European Monetary Institute.

Each Member State with a derogation shall treat its exchange-rate policy as a matter of common
interest. In so doing, it shall take account of the experience acquired in cooperation within the
framework of the exchange-rate mechanism.
Article III-201
1. Where a Member State with a derogation is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with
difficulties as regards its balance of payments either as a result of an overall disequilibrium in its
balance of payments, or as a result of the type of currency at its disposal, and where such difficulties
are liable in particular to jeopardise the functioning of the internal market or the implementation of
the common commercial policy, the Commission shall immediately investigate the position of the
State in question and the action which, making use of all the means at its disposal, that State has
taken or may take in accordance with the Constitution. The Commission shall state what measures it
recommends the Member State concerned to adopt.
If the action taken by a Member State with a derogation and the measures suggested by the
Commission do not prove sufficient to overcome the difficulties which have arisen or which threaten,

The Commission shall keep the Council regularly informed of the situation and of how it evolves.
2. The Council shall adopt European regulations or decisions granting such mutual assistance and
laying down the conditions and details of such assistance, which may take such forms as:
(a) a concerted approach to or within any other international organisations to which Member States
with a derogation may have recourse;
(b) measures needed to avoid deflection of trade where the Member State with a derogation, which is
in difficulties, maintains or reintroduces quantitative restrictions against third countries;
(c) the granting of limited credits by other Member States, subject to their agreement.
3. If the mutual assistance recommended by the Commission is not granted by the Council or if the
mutual assistance granted and the measures taken are insufficient, the Commission shall authorise
the Member State with a derogation, which is in difficulties, to take protective measures, the
conditions and details of which the Commission shall determine.
Such authorisation may be revoked and such conditions and details may be changed by the Council.
Article III-202
1. Where a sudden crisis in the balance of payments occurs and a European decision as referred to
in Article III-201(2) is not immediately adopted, a Member State with a derogation may, as a
precaution, take the necessary protective measures. Such measures must cause the least possible
disturbance in the functioning of the internal market and must not be wider in scope than is strictly
necessary to remedy the sudden difficulties which have arisen.
2. The Commission and the other Member States shall be informed of the protective measures
referred to in paragraph 1 not later than when they enter into force. The Commission may
recommend to the Council the granting of mutual assistance under Article III-201.
3. The Council, acting on a recommendation from the Commission and after consulting the
Economic and Financial Committee may adopt a European decision stipulating that the Member State
concerned shall amend, suspend or abolish the protective measures referred to in paragraph 1.

SOCIAL POLICY
Article III-209
The Union and the Member States, having in mind fundamental social rights such as those set out in
the European Social Charter signed at Turin on 18 October 1961 and in the 1989 Community

employment, improved living and working conditions, so as to make possible their harmonisation
while the improvement is being maintained, proper social protection, dialogue between management
and labour, the development of human resources with a view to lasting high employment and the

To this end the Union and the Member States shall act taking account of the diverse forms of national
practices, in particular in the field of contractual relations, and the need to maintain the
competitiveness of the Union economy.
They believe that such a development will ensue not only from the functioning of the internal

provided for in the Constitution and from the approximation of provisions laid down by law,
regulation or administrative action of the Member States.

minimum requirements for gradual implementation, having regard to the conditions and
technical rules obtaining in each of the Member States. Such European framework laws shall

shall be informed.
Where the agreement in question contains one or more provisions relating to one of the areas for
which unanimity is required pursuant to Article III-210(3), the Council shall act unanimously.
Article III-213
With a view to achieving the objectives of Article III-209 and without prejudice to the other

4. With a view to ensuring full equality in practice between women and men in working life, the
principle of equal treatment shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or adopting
measures providing for specific advantages in order to make it easier for the under-represented sex to
pursue a vocational activity, or to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in professional careers.

Affairs, may also adopt any transitional measures necessary with regard to the application of the acts
already adopted within the framework of enhanced cooperation. However, if the Council considers

1. PROTOCOL ON THE ROLE OF NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,
RECALLING that the way in which national Parliaments scrutinise their governments in relation to the activities of the
Union is a matter for the particular constitutional organisation and practice of each Member State;
DESIRING to encourage greater involvement of national Parliaments in the activities of the European Union and to
enhance their ability to express their views on draft European legislative acts as well as on other matters which may be

212 Part IV
Article 3
National Parliaments may send to the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Council and the
Commission a reasoned opinion on whether a draft European legislative act complies with the
principle of subsidiarity, in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Protocol on the
application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
If the draft European legislative act originates from a group of Member States, the President of the
Council shall forward the reasoned opinion or opinions to the governments of those Member States.
If the draft European legislative act originates from the Court of Justice, the European Central Bank or
the European Investment Bank, the President of the Council shall forward the reasoned opinion or

procedure. Exceptions shall be possible in cases of urgency, the reasons for which shall be stated in
the act or position of the Council. Save in urgent cases for which due reasons have been given, no
agreement may be reached on a draft European legislative act during those six weeks. Save in urgent

2. PROTOCOL ON THE APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF SUBSIDIARITY AND
PROPORTIONALITY
THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,
WISHING to ensure that decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizens of the Union;
RESOLVED to establish the conditions for the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, as laid
down in Article I-11 of the Constitution, and to establish a system for monitoring the application of those principles,
HAVE AGREED UPON the following provisions, which shall be annexed to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for
Europe:
Article 1
Each institution shall ensure constant respect for the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, as
laid down in Article I-11 of the Constitution.
Article 2
Before proposing European legislative acts, the Commission shall consult widely. Such consultations
shall, where appropriate, take into account the regional and local dimension of the action envisaged.
In cases of exceptional urgency, the Commission shall not conduct such consultations. It shall give
reasons for its decision in its proposal.
Article 3
For the purposes of this Protocol, ‘draft European legislative acts’ shall mean proposals from the
Commission, initiatives from a group of Member States, initiatives from the European Parliament,
requests from the Court of Justice, recommendations from the European Central Bank and requests
from the European Investment Bank for the adoption of a European legislative act.
Article 4
The Commission shall forward its draft European legislative acts and its amended drafts to national
Parliaments at the same time as to the Union legislator.
The European Parliament shall forward its draft European legislative acts and its amended drafts to
national Parliaments.
The Council shall forward draft European legislative acts originating from a group of Member States,

954393_TRAITE_EN_201_250 12-01-2005 14:58 Pagina 214
Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 215
Article 5
Draft European legislative acts shall be justified with regard to the principles of subsidiarity and
proportionality. Any draft European legislative act should contain a detailed statement making it
possible to appraise compliance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
This statement should contain some assessment of the proposal's financial impact and, in the case
of a European framework law, of its implications for the rules to be put in place by Member States,
including, where necessary, the regional legislation. The reasons for concluding that a Union objective
can be better achieved at Union level shall be substantiated by qualitative and, wherever possible,
quantitative indicators. Draft European legislative acts shall take account of the need for any burden,
whether financial or administrative, falling upon the Union, national governments, regional or local
authorities, economic operators and citizens, to be minimised and commensurate with the objective
to be achieved.
Article 6
Any national Parliament or any chamber of a national Parliament may, within six weeks from the
date of transmission of a draft European legislative act, send to the Presidents of the European
Parliament, the Council and the Commission a reasoned opinion stating why it considers that the
draft in question does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity. It will be for each national
Parliament or each chamber of a national Parliament to consult, where appropriate, regional
parliaments with legislative powers.
If the draft European legislative act originates from a group of Member States, the President of the
Council shall forward the opinion to the governments of those Member States.
If the draft European legislative act originates from the Court of Justice, the European Central Bank or
the European Investment Bank, the President of the Council shall forward the opinion to the
institution or body concerned.
Article 7
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and, where appropriate, the group of
Member States, the Court of Justice, the European Central Bank or the European Investment Bank, if
the draft legislative act originates from them, shall take account of the reasoned opinions issued by
national Parliaments or by a chamber of a national Parliament.
Each national Parliament shall have two votes, shared out on the basis of the national Parliamentary
system. In the case of a bicameral Parliamentary system, each of the two chambers shall have
one vote.
Where reasoned opinions on a draft European legislative act's non-compliance with the principle of
subsidiarity represent at least one third of all the votes allocated to the national Parliaments in
accordance with the second paragraph, the draft must be reviewed. This threshold shall be a quarter
in the case of a draft European legislative act submitted on the basis of Article III–264 of the
Constitution on the area of freedom, security and justice.
954393_TRAITE_EN_201_250 12-01-2005 14:59 Pagina 215
216 Part IV
After such review, the Commission or, where appropriate, the group of Member States, the European
Parliament, the Court of Justice, the European Central Bank or the European Investment Bank, if the
draft European legislative act originates from them, may decide to maintain, amend or withdraw the
draft. Reasons must be given for this decision.
Article 8
The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction in actions on grounds of
infringement of the principle of subsidiarity by a European legislative act, brought in accordance with
the rules laid down in Article III-365 of the Constitution by Member States, or notified by them in
accordance with their legal order on behalf of their national Parliament or a chamber of it.
In accordance with the rules laid down in the said Article, the Committee of the Regions may also
bring such actions against European legislative acts for the adoption of which the Constitution
provides that it be consulted.
Article 9
The Commission shall submit each year to the European Council, the European Parliament, the
Council and national Parliaments a report on the application of Article I-11 of the Constitution. This
annual report shall also be forwarded to the Committee of the Regions and to the Economic and
Social Committee.

Europe and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community:
Article 1

TITLE I

Before taking up his duties each Judge shall, before the Court of Justice sitting in open court, take an
oath to perform his duties impartially and conscientiously and to preserve the secrecy of the

Article 3
The Judges shall be immune from legal proceedings. After they have ceased to hold office, they shall

The Court of Justice, sitting as a full Court, may waive the immunity. If the decision concerns a
member of the General Court or of a specialised court, the Court shall decide after consulting the
court concerned.
Where immunity has been waived and criminal proceedings are instituted against a Judge, he shall be
tried, in any of the Member States, only by the court competent to judge the members of the highest
national judiciary.
Articles 11 to 14 and Article 17 of the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of the Union shall

Article 4
The Judges may not hold any political or administrative office.

term of office, they will respect the obligations arising therefrom, in particular the duty to behave
with integrity and discretion as regards the acceptance, after they have ceased to hold office, of
certain appointments or benefits.
Any doubt on this point shall be settled by decision of the Court of Justice. If the decision concerns a
member of the General Court or of a specialised court, the Court shall decide after consulting the
court concerned.
Article 5
Apart from normal replacement, or death, the duties of a Judge shall end when he resigns.
Where a Judge resigns, his letter of resignation shall be addressed to the President of the Court of
Justice for transmission to the President of the Council. Upon this notification a vacancy shall arise
on the bench.
Save where Article 6 applies, a Judge shall continue to hold office until his successor takes up his
duties.
Article 6
A Judge may be deprived of his office or of his right to a pension or other benefits in its stead only if,
in the unanimous opinion of the Judges and Advocates-General of the Court of Justice, he no longer
fulfils the requisite conditions or meets the obligations arising from his office. The Judge concerned
shall not take part in any such deliberations. If the person concerned is a member of the General
Court or of a specialised court, the Court shall decide after consulting the court concerned.
The Registrar of the Court of Justice shall communicate the decision of the Court of Justice to the
President of the European Parliament and to the President of the Commission and shall notify it to
the President of the Council.
In the case of a decision depriving a Judge of his office, a vacancy shall arise on the bench upon this
latter notification.
Article 7
A Judge who is to replace a member of the Court of Justice whose term of office has not expired shall
be appointed for the remainder of his predecessor's term.
Article 8
The provisions of Articles 2 to 7 shall apply to the Advocates-General.

disposing of a procedural issue concerning a plea of lack of competence or inadmissibility, shall be
notified by the Registrar of the General Court to all parties as well as all Member States and the

Article 56
An appeal may be brought before the Court of Justice, within two months of the notification of the
decision appealed against, against final decisions of the General Court and decisions of that Court
disposing of the substantive issues in part only or disposing of a procedural issue concerning a plea
of lack of competence or inadmissibility.
Such an appeal may be brought by any party which has been unsuccessful, in whole or in part, in its
submissions. However, interveners other than the Member States and the institutions of the Union
may bring such an appeal only where the decision of the General Court directly affects them.
With the exception of cases relating to disputes between the Union and its servants, an appeal may
also be brought by Member States and institutions of the Union which did not intervene in the
proceedings before the General Court. Such Member States and institutions shall be in the same
position as Member States or institutions which intervened at first instance.
Article 57

declaring a European law or European regulation binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all
Member States to be void shall take effect only as from the date of expiry of the period referred to in

to apply to the Court of Justice, pursuant to Article III-379(1) and (2) of the Constitution, and
Article 157 of the EAEC Treaty for the suspension of the effects of the European law or European
regulation which has been declared void or for the prescription of any other interim measure.

If the appeal is well founded, the Court of Justice shall quash the decision of the General Court. It may
itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits, or refer the
case back to the General Court for judgment.
Where a case is referred back to the General Court, that Court shall be bound by the decision of the
Court of Justice on points of law.
When an appeal brought by a Member State or an institution of the Union, which did not intervene
in the proceedings before the General Court, is well founded, the Court of Justice may, if it considers
this necessary, state which of the effects of the decision of the General Court which has been quashed
shall be considered as definitive in respect of the parties to the litigation.
Article 62
In the cases provided for in Article III-358(2) and (3) of the Constitution, where the First Advocate-
General considers that there is a serious risk of the unity or consistency of Union law being affected,
he may propose that the Court of Justice review the decision of the General Court.
The proposal must be made within one month of delivery of the decision by the General Court.
Within one month of receiving the proposal made by the First Advocate-General, the Court of Justice
shall decide whether or not the decision should be reviewed.

the members of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank and the Governors of the national
central banks of the Member States without a derogation as referred to in Article III-197 of the
Constitution.
2. Each member of the Governing Council shall have one vote. As from the date on which the
number of members of the Governing Council exceeds 21, each member of the Executive Board shall
have one vote and the number of governors with a voting right shall be 15. The latter voting rights
shall be assigned and shall rotate as follows:
(a) as from the date on which the number of governors exceeds 15 and until it reaches 22, the
governors shall be allocated to two groups, according to a ranking of the size of the share of their
national central bank's Member State in the aggregate gross domestic product at market prices
and in the total aggregated balance sheet of the monetary financial institutions of the Member
States whose currency is the euro. The shares in the aggregate gross domestic product at market
prices and in the total aggregated balance sheet of the monetary financial institutions shall be
assigned weights of 5/6 and 1/6, respectively. The first group shall be composed of five governors
and the second group of the remaining governors. The frequency of voting rights of the

Article 29(2) shall apply. The total aggregated balance sheet of the monetary financial institutions
shall be calculated in accordance with the statistical framework applying in the Union at the time
of the calculation;
(e) whenever the aggregate gross domestic product at market prices is adjusted in accordance with
Article 29(3), or whenever the number of governors increases, the size and/or composition of the
groups shall be adjusted in accordance with the principles laid down in this subparagraph;
(f) the Governing Council, acting by a two-thirds majority of all its members, with and without a
voting right, shall take all measures necessary for the implementation of the principles laid down
in this subparagraph and may decide to postpone the start of the rotation system until the date

at which decisions may be taken without regard to the quorum.

Governing Council shall be weighted according to the national central banks' shares in the subscribed
capital of the European Central Bank. The weighting of the votes of the members of the Executive
Board shall be zero. A decision requiring a qualified majority shall be adopted if the votes cast in
favour represent at least two thirds of the subscribed capital of the European Central Bank and
represent at least half of the shareholders. If a Governor is unable to be present, he may nominate an
alternate to cast his weighted vote.

banks of Member States with a derogation shall not pay up their subscribed capital unless the General

Deferred payment of capital, reserves and provisions of the European Central Bank

of other Member States whose currency is the euro, and shall transfer to the European Central Bank

shares already paid up by the other national central banks.

concerned shall contribute to the reserves of the European Central Bank, to those provisions

amount of the reserves, as defined above and as stated in the approved balance sheet of the European

banks becoming part of the European System of Central Banks, the subscribed capital of the
European Central Bank and the limit on the amount of foreign reserve assets that may be transferred

multiplying the respective amounts then prevailing by the ratio, within the expanded capital key,
954393_TRAITE_EN_251_300 12-01-2005 15:20 Pagina 252
Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 253
between the weighting of the entering national central banks concerned and the weighting of the
national central banks already members of the European System of Central Banks. Each national
central bank's weighting in the capital key shall be calculated by analogy with Article 29(1) and in
compliance with Article 29(2). The reference periods to be used for the statistical data shall be
identical to those applied for the latest quinquennial adjustment of the weightings under Article 29
(3).
Article 49

Article 32 results in significant changes in national central banks' relative income positions, the
amount of income to be allocated pursuant to Article 32 shall be reduced by a uniform percentage
which shall not exceed 60 % in the first financial year after the start of the third stage and which shall
decrease by at least 12 percentage points in each subsequent financial year.

Federation, San Marino, South Africa, South Korea, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and

States and the Community before 1 May 2004.
Any adjustments to these Agreements shall be the subject of protocols concluded with the
cocontracting countries in conformity with the provisions of the second subparagraph of paragraph
1. Should the protocols not have been concluded by 1 May 2004, the Union, the European Atomic
Energy Community and the Member States shall take, in the framework of their respective
competences, the necessary measures to deal with that situation.
5. As from 1 May 2004, the new Member States shall apply the bilateral textile agreements and

those agreements shall be adopted in each case by the Council on a proposal from the Commission,
including the possibility of extending certain agreements for periods not exceeding one year.

agreements with third countries, including the Central European Free Trade Agreement.

one or more third countries on the other, are not compatible with the obligations arising from the
Constitution and in particular from this Protocol, the new Member States shall take all appropriate
steps to eliminate the incompatibilities established. If a new Member State encounters difficulties in
adjusting an agreement concluded with one or more third countries before accession, it shall,
according to the terms of the agreement, withdraw from that agreement.
9. The new Member States shall take appropriate measures, where necessary, to adjust their
position in relation to international organisations, and in relation to those international agreements

Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 of 21 June 1999 on coordinating aid to the applicant countries in the
framework of the preaccession strategy and amending Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 (1).
If these decisions to waive ex ante control have not been adopted before 1 May 2004, any contracts
signed between 1 May 2004 and the date on which the Commission decisions are taken shall not be
eligible for preaccession assistance.
However, exceptionally, if the Commission decisions to waive exante control are delayed beyond
1 May 2004 for reasons not attributable to the authorities of a new Member State, the Commission
may accept, in duly justified cases, eligibility for preaccession assistance of contracts signed between
1 May 2004 and the date of these decisions, and the continued implementation of preaccession
assistance for a limited period, subject to ex ante control by the Commission over tendering and
contracting.
2. Global budget commitments made before 1 May 2004 under the preaccession financial
instruments referred to in paragraph 1, including the conclusion and registration of subsequent
individual legal commitments and payments made after 1 May 2004, shall continue to be governed
by the rules and regulations of the preaccession financing instruments and be charged to the
corresponding budget chapters until closure of the programmes and projects concerned.

out in accordance with the relevant Union acts.
3. The last programming exercise for the preaccession assistance referred to in paragraph 1 shall
take place in the last full calendar year preceding 1 May 2004. Actions under these programmes will
have to be contracted within the following two years and disbursements made as provided for in the
Financing Memorandum (2), usually by the end of the third year after the commitment. No
extensions shall be granted for the contracting period. Exceptionally and in duly justified cases,
limited extensions in terms of duration may be granted for disbursement.
4. In order to ensure the necessary phasing out of the preaccession financial instruments referred
to in paragraph 1 as well as the ISPA programme, and a smooth transition from the rules applicable
before and after 1 May 2004, the Commission may take all appropriate measures to ensure that the
necessary statutory staff is maintained in the new Member States for a maximum of fifteen months
following that date.
During this period, officials assigned to posts in the new Member States before accession and who are
required to remain in service in those States after 1 May 2004 shall benefit, as an exception, from the
same financial and material conditions as were applied by the Commission before 1 May 2004
in accordance with Annex X to the Staff Regulations of officials and the conditions of employment
of other servants of the European Communities laid down in Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC)

5. Where projects approved under Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 can no longer be funded under
that instrument, they may be integrated into rural development programming and financed under the
European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. Should specific transitional measures be
necessary in this regard, these shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedures
laid down in Article 50(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down
general provisions on the Structural Funds (2).

Article 26
1. If, until the end of a period of up to three years after 1 May 2004, difficulties arise which are
serious and liable to persist in any sector of the economy or which could bring about serious
deterioration in the economic situation of a given area, a new Member State may apply for
authorisation to take protective measures in order to rectify the situation and adjust the sector
concerned to the economy of the internal market.
In the same circumstances, any present Member State may apply for authorisation to take protective
measures with regard to one or more of the new Member States.
2. Upon request by the State concerned, the Commission shall, by emergency procedure, adopt the
European regulations or decisions establishing the protective measures which it considers necessary,
specifying the conditions and modalities under which they are to be put into effect.
In the event of serious economic difficulties and at the express request of the Member State
concerned, the Commission shall act within five working days of the receipt of the request
accompanied by the relevant background information. The measures thus decided on shall be
applicable forthwith, shall take account of the interests of all parties concerned and shall not entail
frontier controls.
3. The measures authorised under paragraph 2 may involve derogations from the rules of the
Constitution, and in particular from this Protocol, to such an extent and for such periods as are
strictly necessary in order to attain the objectives referred to in paragraph 1. Priority shall be given to
such measures as will least disturb the functioning of the internal market.
Article 27
If a new Member State has failed to implement commitments undertaken in the context of the
accession negotiations, causing a serious breach of the functioning of the internal market, including
any commitments in all sectoral policies which concern economic activities with crossborder effect,
or an imminent risk of such breach, the Commission may, until the end of a period of up to three
years after 1 May 2004, upon the motivated request of a Member State or on its own initiative, adopt
European regulations or decisions establishing appropriate measures.
Measures shall be proportional and priority shall be given to measures which least disturb the
functioning of the internal market and, where appropriate, to the application of the existing sectoral
safeguard mechanisms. Such safeguard measures shall not be invoked as a means of arbitrary
discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States. The measures shall be

5. Any subsequent privatisation of any of the benefiting companies shall respect the conditions and

the reduction and use of capacity and shall provide sufficient financial data to allow an
assessment to be made of whether the conditions and requirements contained in this Title have

6. The restructuring aid granted to the benefiting companies shall be determined by the
justifications set out in the approved Polish steel restructuring plan and individual business plans as

bankruptcy of a steel company shall not qualify as capacity reduction.
The net capacity reductions shown in Annex 2 to Protocol 8 to the Act of Accession of 16 April
2003 are minima and actual net capacity reductions to be achieved and the time frame for doing so

13. In addition to the monitoring of State aid, the Commission and the Council shall monitor the
restructuring benchmarks set out in Annex 3 to Protocol 8 to the Act of Accession of 16 April 2003.
References made in that Annex to paragraph 14 of the Protocol shall be construed as being made to
paragraph 14 of this Article.
14. Monitoring shall include an independent evaluation to be carried out in 2003, 2004, 2005 and
2006. The Commission's viability test shall be applied and productivity shall be measured as part of
the evaluation.
15. Poland shall cooperate fully with all the arrangements for monitoring. In particular:
(a) Poland shall supply the Commission with sixmonthly reports concerning the restructuring of
the benefiting companies, no later than 15 March and 15 September of each year, until the end of
the restructuring period;
(b) the first report shall reach the Commission by 15 March 2003 and the last report by 15 March

Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 339
have been fulfilled. The reports shall at the least contain the information set out in Annex 4 to
Protocol 8 to the Act of Accession of 16 April 2003, which the Commission reserves the right to

monitoring results, undertake any research necessary and report to the Commission and the Council.
17. If the Commission establishes, on the basis of the monitoring, that substantial deviations from
the financial data on which the viability assessment has been made have occurred, it may require
Poland to take appropriate measures to reinforce or modify the restructuring measures of the
benefiting companies concerned.
18. Should the monitoring show that:
(a) the conditions for the transitional arrangements contained in this Title have not been fulfilled, or
that
(b) the commitments made in the framework of the extension of the period during which Poland
may exceptionally grant State support for the restructuring of its steel industry under the Europe
Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member
States, of the one part, and Poland, of the other part, have not been fulfilled, or that
(c) Poland in the course of the restructuring period has granted additional incompatible State aid to
the steel industry and to the benefiting companies in particular, the transitional arrangements
contained in this Title shall not have effect.
The Commission shall take appropriate steps requiring any company concerned to reimburse any aid
granted in breach of the conditions laid down in this Title.

another Member State; in that case the Council shall be immediately informed; the application
shall be dealt with on the basis of the presumption that it is manifestly unfounded without
affecting in any way, whatever the case may be, the decisionmaking power of the Member State.

25. PROTOCOL CONCERNING IMPORTS INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION
OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS REFINED IN THE NETHERLANDS ANTILLES
THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,
BEING DESIROUS of giving fuller details about the system of trade applicable to imports into the Union of
petroleum products refined in the Netherlands Antilles,
HAVE AGREED on the following provisions, which shall be annexed to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for
Europe:
Article 1
This Protocol is applicable to petroleum products coming under the Combined Nomenclature
headings 2710, 2711, 2712 (paraffin wax and petroleum wax), ex 2713 (paraffin residues) and 2714
(shale wax), imported for use in the Member States.
Article 2
Member States shall undertake to grant to petroleum products refined in the Netherlands Antilles the
tariff preferences resulting from the Association of the latter with the Union, under the conditions
provided for by this Protocol. These provisions shall hold good whatever may be the rules of origin
applied by the Member States.
Article 3
1. When the Commission, at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative, establishes that
imports into the Union of petroleum products refined in the Netherlands Antilles under the system
provided for in Article 2 are giving rise to real difficulties on the market of one or more
Member States, it shall adopt a European decision establishing that customs duties on the said
imports shall be introduced, increased or reintroduced by the Member States in question, to such an
extent and for such a period as may be necessary to meet that situation. The rates of the customs
duties thus introduced, increased or reintroduced may not exceed the customs duties applicable to
third countries for these same products.
2. The provisions of paragraph 1 can in any case be applied when imports into the Union of
petroleum products refined in the Netherlands Antilles reach two million tonnes a year.
3. The Council shall be informed of European decisions adopted by the Commission in pursuance
of paragraphs 1 and 2, including those directed at rejecting the request of a Member State.

376 Part IV
Article 4
1. If a Member State considers that imports of petroleum products refined in the
Netherlands Antilles, made either directly or through another Member State under the system
provided for in Article 2, are giving rise to real difficulties on its market and that immediate action is
necessary to meet them, it may on its own initiative decide to apply customs duties to such imports,
the rate of which may not exceed those of the customs duties applicable to third countries in respect
of the same products. It shall notify its decision to the Commission, which shall within one month
adopt a European decision establishing whether the measures taken by the State should be
maintained or must be amended or cancelled. Article 3(3) shall be applicable to such decision of the
Commission.
2. When the quantities of petroleum products refined in the Netherlands Antilles imported either
directly or through another Member State, under the system provided for in Article 2, into a
Member State or States exceed during a calendar year the tonnage shown in the Annex to this
Protocol, the measures taken in pursuance of paragraph 1 by that or those Member States for the
current year shall be considered to be justified. The Commission shall, after assuring itself that the
tonnage fixed has been reached, formally record the measures taken. In such a case the other
Member States shall abstain from formally placing the matter before the Council.
Article 5
If the Union decides to apply quantitative restrictions to petroleum products, no matter whence they
are imported, these restrictions may also be applied to imports of such products from the
Netherlands Antilles. In this case preferential treatment shall be granted to the Netherlands Antilles as
compared with third countries.
Article 6
1. Articles 2 to 5 may be reviewed by the Council, by unanimous decision, after consulting the
European Parliament and the Commission, when a common definition of origin for
petroleum products from third countries and associated countries is adopted, or when decisions
are taken within the framework of a common commercial policy for the products in question or
when a common energy policy is established.
2. When such revision is made, however, equivalent preferences shall in any case be maintained
in favour of the Netherlands Antilles in a suitable form and for a minimum quantity of 2 1/2 million
tonnes of petroleum products.
3. The Union's commitments in regard to equivalent preferences as referred to in paragraph 2 may,
if necessary, be broken down State by State taking into account the tonnage indicated in the Annex to
this Protocol.
Article 7
For the implementation of this Protocol, the Commission is responsible for following the pattern of
imports into the Member States of petroleum products refined in the Netherlands Antilles.
Member States shall communicate to the Commission, which shall see that it is circulated, all useful
information to that end in accordance with the administrative conditions recommended by it.

A. DECLARATIONS CONCERNING PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION
1. Declaration on Article I-6
The Conference notes that Article I-6 reflects existing case-law of the Court of Justice of the European
Communities and of the Court of First Instance.
2. Declaration on Article I-9(2)
The Conference agrees that the Union's accession to the European Convention on the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms should be arranged in such a way as to preserve the
specific features of Union law. In this connection, the Conference notes the existence of a regular
dialogue between the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human
Rights; such dialogue could be reinforced when the Union accedes to that Convention.
3. Declaration on Articles I-22, I-27 and I-28
In choosing the persons called upon to hold the offices of President of the European Council,
President of the Commission and Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, due account is to be taken of the
need to respect the geographical and demographic diversity of the Union and its Member States.
4. Declaration on Article I-24(7) concerning the European Council decision on the
exercise of the Presidency of the Council
The Conference declares that the Council should begin preparing the European decision establishing
the measures for applying the European decision of the European Council on the exercise of the
Presidency of the Council as soon as the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe is signed and
should give its political approval within six months. A draft European decision of the European
Council, which will be adopted on the date of entry into force of the said Treaty, is set out below:
DRAFT EUROPEAN DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL ON THE EXERCISE OF THE PRESIDENCY
OF THE COUNCIL
Article 1
1. The Presidency of the Council, with the exception of the Foreign Affairs configuration, shall be
held by pre-established groups of three Member States for a period of 18 months. The groups shall be
made up on a basis of equal rotation among the Member States, taking into account their diversity
and geographical balance within the Union.
2. Each member of the group shall in turn chair for a six-month period all configurations of the
Council, with the exception of the Foreign Affairs configuration. The other members of the group
shall assist the Chair in all its responsibilities on the basis of a common programme. Members of the
team may decide alternative arrangements among themselves.
428 Final act
954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450 13-01-2005 08:14 Pagina 428
Article 2
The Committee of Permanent Representatives of the Governments of the Member States shall be
chaired by a representative of the Member State chairing the General Affairs Council.
The Chair of the Political and Security Committee shall be held by a representative of the Union
Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The chair of the preparatory bodies of the various Council configurations, with the exception of the
Foreign Affairs configuration, shall fall to the member of the group chairing the relevant
configuration, unless decided otherwise in accordance with Article 4.
Article 3
The General Affairs Council shall ensure consistency and continuity in the work of the different
Council configurations in the framework of multiannual programmes in cooperation with the
Commission. The Member States holding the Presidency shall take all necessary measures for the
organisation and smooth operation of the Council's work, with the assistance of the General
Secretariat of the Council.
Article 4
The Council shall adopt a European decision establishing the measures for the implementation of this
decision.
5. Declaration on Article I-25
The Conference declares that the European decision relating to the implementation of Article I-25
will be adopted by the Council on the day the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe enters
into force. The draft decision is set out below:
DRAFT EUROPEAN DECISION OF THE COUNCIL
RELATING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE I-25
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Whereas:
(1) Provisions should be adopted allowing for a smooth transition from the system for decisionmaking
in the Council by a qualified majority as defined in the Treaty of Nice and set out in
Article 2(2) of the Protocol on the transitional provisions relating to the institutions and bodies
of the Union annexed to the Constitution, which will continue to apply until 31 October 2009,
to the voting system provided for in Article I-25 of the Constitution, which will apply with effect
from 1 November 2009.
(2) It is recalled that it is the practice of the Council to devote every effort to strengthening the
democratic legitimacy of decisions taken by a qualified majority.
Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 429
954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450 13-01-2005 08:14 Pagina 429
(3) It is judged appropriate to maintain this decision as long as is necessary to ensure smooth
transition to the new voting system provided for in the Constitution,
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
Article 1
If members of the Council, representing:
(a) at least three quarters of the population; or
(b) at least three quarters of the number of Member States.
necessary to constitute a blocking minority resulting from the application of Article I-25(1),
first subparagraph, or Article I-25(2), indicate their opposition to the Council adopting an act by
a qualified majority, the Council shall discuss the issue.
Article 2
The Council shall, in the course of these discussions, do all in its power to reach, within a reasonable
time and without prejudicing obligatory time limits laid down by Union law, a satisfactory solution to
address concerns raised by the members of the Council referred to in Article 1.
Article 3
To this end, the President of the Council, with the assistance of the Commission and in compliance
with the Rules of Procedure of the Council, shall undertake any initiative necessary to facilitate a
wider basis of agreement in the Council. The members of the Council shall lend him or her their
assistance.
Article 4
This decision shall take effect on 1 November 2009. It shall remain in force at least until 2014.
Thereafter the Council may adopt a European decision repealing it.
6. Declaration on Article I-26
The Conference considers that when the Commission no longer includes nationals of all
Member States, the Commission should pay particular attention to the need to ensure full
transparency in relations with all Member States. Accordingly, the Commission should liaise closely
with all Member States, whether or not they have a national serving as member of the Commission,
and in this context pay special attention to the need to share information and consult with all
Member States.
The Conference also considers that the Commission should take all the necessary measures to ensure
that political, social and economic realities in all Member States, including those which have no
430 Final act
954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450 13-01-2005 08:14 Pagina 430
national serving as member of the Commission, are fully taken into account. These measures should
include ensuring that the position of those Member States is addressed by appropriate organisational
arrangements.
7. Declaration on Article I-27
The Conference considers that, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the European
Parliament and the European Council are jointly responsible for the smooth running of the process
leading to the election of the President of the European Commission. Prior to the decision of the
European Council, representatives of the European Parliament and of the European Council will thus
conduct the necessary consultations in the framework deemed the most appropriate. These
consultations will focus on the backgrounds of the candidates for President of the Commission,
taking account of the elections to the European Parliament, in accordance with Article I-27(1). The
arrangements for such consultations may be determined, in due course, by common accord between
the European Parliament and the European Council.
8. Declaration on Article I-36
The Conference takes note of the Commission's intention to continue to consult experts appointed
by the Member States in the preparation of draft delegated European regulations in the financial
services area, in accordance with its established practice.
9. Declaration on Articles I-43 and III-329
Without prejudice to the measures adopted by the Union to comply with its solidarity obligation
towards a Member State which is the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of natural or man-made
disaster, none of the provisions of Articles I-43 and III-329 of the Constitution is intended to affect
the right of another Member State to choose the most appropriate means to comply with its own
solidarity obligation towards that Member State.
10. Declaration on Article I-51
The Conference declares that, whenever rules on protection of personal data to be adopted on the
basis of Article I-51 could have direct implications for national security, due account will have to be
taken of the specific characteristics of the matter. It recalls that the legislation presently applicable (see
in particular Directive 95/46/EC) includes specific derogations in this regard.
11. Declaration on Article I-57
The Union will take into account the particular situation of small-sized countries which maintain
specific relations of proximity with it.

12. Declaration concerning the explanations relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights
The Conference takes note of the explanations relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights
prepared under the authority of the Praesidium of the Convention which drafted the Charter and
updated under the responsibility of the Praesidium of the European Convention, as set out below.
EXPLANATIONS RELATING TO THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
These explanations were originally prepared under the authority of the Praesidium of the Convention
which drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. They have been updated
under the responsibility of the Praesidium of the European Convention, in the light of the drafting
adjustments made to the text of the Charter by that Convention (notably to Articles 51 and 52 (1))
and of further developments of Union law. Although they do not as such have the status of law, they
are a valuable tool of interpretation intended to clarify the provisions of the Charter.
PREAMBLE
The peoples of Europe, in creating an ever closer union among them, are resolved to share a peaceful
future based on common values.
Conscious of its spiritual and moral heritage, the Union is founded on the indivisible, universal values
of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity; it is based on the principles of democracy and the
rule of law. It places the individual at the heart of its activities, by establishing the citizenship of the
Union and by creating an area of freedom, security and justice.
The Union contributes to the preservation and to the development of these common values while
respecting the diversity of the cultures and traditions of the peoples of Europe as well as the national
identities of the Member States and the organisation of their public authorities at national, regional
and local levels; it seeks to promote balanced and sustainable development and ensures free
movement of persons, services, goods and capital, and the freedom of establishment.
To this end, it is necessary to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights in the light of changes
in society, social progress and scientific and technological developments by making those rights more
visible in a Charter.
This Charter reaffirms, with due regard for the powers and tasks of the Union and the principle of
subsidiarity, the rights as they result, in particular, from the constitutional traditions and international
obligations common to the Member States, the European Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Social Charters adopted by the Union and by the
Council of Europe and the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and of the
European Court of Human Rights. In this context the Charter will be interpreted by the courts of the
Union and the Member States with due regard to the explanations prepared under the authority of
the Praesidium of the Convention which drafted the Charter and updated under the responsibility of
(1) Articles II-111 and II-112 of the Constitution.

the Praesidium of the European Convention.
Enjoyment of these rights entails responsibilities and duties with regard to other persons, to the
human community and to future generations.
The Union therefore recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out hereafter.
TITLE I
DIGNITY
Article 1 (1)
Human dignity
Human dignity is inviolable. It must be respected and protected.
Explanation
The dignity of the human person is not only a fundamental right in itself but constitutes the real basis of fundamental
rights. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrined human dignity in its preamble: ‘Whereas
recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the
foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.’ In its judgment of 9 October 2001 in case C-377/98
Netherlands v European Parliament and Council [2001] ECR 7079, at grounds 70 to 77, the Court of Justice confirmed
that a fundamental right to human dignity is part of Union law.
It results that none of the rights laid down in this Charter may be used to harm the dignity of another person, and that
the dignity of the human person is part of the substance of the rights laid down in this Charter. It must therefore be
respected, even where a right is restricted.
Article 2 (2)
Right to life
1. Everyone has the right to life.
2. No one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed.
Explanation
1. Paragraph 1 of this Article is based on the first sentence of Article 2(1) of the ECHR, which reads as follows:
‘1. Everyone's right to life shall be protected by law…’
(1) Article II-61 of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-62 of the Constitution.
Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 433
954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450 13-01-2005 08:14 Pagina 433
2. The second sentence of the provision, which referred to the death penalty, was superseded by the entry into force
of Article 1 of Protocol No 6 to the ECHR, which reads as follows:
‘The death penalty shall be abolished. No-one shall be condemned to such penalty or executed.’
Article 2(2) of the Charter (1) is based on that provision.
3. The provisions of Article 2 of the Charter (2) correspond to those of the above Articles of the ECHR and its
Protocol. They have the same meaning and the same scope, in accordance with Article 52(3) of the Charter (3).
Therefore, the ‘negative’ definitions appearing in the ECHR must be regarded as also forming part of the Charter:
(a) Article 2(2) of the ECHR:
‘Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this article when it results from the
use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:
(a) in defence of any person from unlawful violence;
(b) in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;
(c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection.’
(b) Article 2 of Protocol 6 to the ECHR:
‘A State may make provision in its law for the death penalty in respect of acts committed in time of war or of
imminent threat of war; such penalty shall be applied only in the instances laid down in the law and in
accordance with its provisions…’
Article 3 (4)
Right to the integrity of the person
1. Everyone has the right to respect for his or her physical and mental integrity.
2. In the fields of medicine and biology, the following must be respected in particular:
(a) the free and informed consent of the person concerned, according to the procedures laid down
by law;
(b) the prohibition of eugenic practices, in particular those aiming at the selection of persons;
(1) Article II-62(2) of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-62 of the Constitution.
(3) Article II-112(3) of the Constitution.
(4) Article II-63 of the Constitution.
434 Final act
954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450 13-01-2005 08:14 Pagina 434
(c) the prohibition on making the human body and its parts as such a source of financial gain;
(d) the prohibition of the reproductive cloning of human beings.
Explanation
1. In its judgment of 9 October 2001 in case C-377/98 Netherlands v European Parliament and Council [2001] ECR
7079, at grounds 70, 78 to 80, the Court of Justice confirmed that a fundamental right to human integrity is part
of Union law and encompasses, in the context of medicine and biology, the free and informed consent of the donor
and recipient.
2. The principles of Article 3 of the Charter (1) are already included in the Convention on Human Rights and
Biomedicine, adopted by the Council of Europe (ETS 164 and additional protocol ETS 168). The Charter does not
set out to depart from those principles, and therefore prohibits only reproductive cloning. It neither authorises nor
prohibits other forms of cloning. Thus it does not in any way prevent the legislature from prohibiting other forms
of cloning.
3. The reference to eugenic practices, in particular those aiming at the selection of persons, relates to possible
situations in which selection programmes are organised and implemented, involving campaigns for sterilisation,
forced pregnancy, compulsory ethnic marriage among others, all acts deemed to be international crimes in the
Statute of the International Criminal Court adopted in Rome on 17 July 1998 (see its Article 7(1)(g)).
Article 4 (2)
Prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
Explanation
The right in Article 4 (2) is the right guaranteed by Article 3 of the ECHR, which has the same wording: ‘No one shall be
subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’. By virtue of Article 52(3) of the Charter (3),
it therefore has the same meaning and the same scope as the ECHR Article.
Article 5 (4)
Prohibition of slavery and forced labour
1. No one shall be held in slavery or servitude.
(1) Article II-63 of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-64 of the Constitution.
(3) Article II-112(3) of the Constitution.
(4) Article II-65 of the Constitution.
Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 435
954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450 13-01-2005 08:14 Pagina 435
2. No one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour.
3. Trafficking in human beings is prohibited.
Explanation
1. The right in Article 5(1) and (2) (1) corresponds to Article 4(1) and (2) of the ECHR, which has the same wording. It
therefore has the same meaning and scope as the ECHR Article, by virtue of Article 52(3) of the Charter (2).
Consequently:
— no limitation may legitimately affect the right provided for in paragraph 1;
— in paragraph 2, ‘forced or compulsory labour’ must be understood in the light of the ‘negative’ definitions
contained in Article 4(3) of the ECHR:
‘For the purpose of this article the term “forced or compulsory labour” shall not include:
(a) any work required to be done in the ordinary course of detention imposed according to the provisions of
Article 5 of this Convention or during conditional release from such detention;
(b) any service of a military character or, in case of conscientious objectors in countries where they are
recognised, service exacted instead of compulsory military service;
(c) any service exacted in case of an emergency or calamity threatening the life or well-being of the
community;
(d) any work or service which forms part of normal civic obligations.’
2. Paragraph 3 stems directly from human dignity and takes account of recent developments in organised crime, such
as the organisation of lucrative illegal immigration or sexual exploitation networks. The Annex to the Europol
Convention contains the following definition which refers to trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation:
‘traffic in human beings: means subjection of a person to the real and illegal sway of other persons by using
violence or menaces or by abuse of authority or intrigue with a view to the exploitation of prostitution, forms of
sexual exploitation and assault of minors or trade in abandoned children’. Chapter VI of the Convention
implementing the Schengen Agreement, which has been integrated into the Union's acquis, in which the United
Kingdom and Ireland participate, contains the following wording in Article 27(1) which refers to illegal
immigration networks: ‘The Contracting Parties undertake to impose appropriate penalties on any person who, for
financial gain, assists or tries to assist an alien to enter or reside within the territory of one of the Contracting
Parties in breach of that Contracting Party's laws on the entry and residence of aliens.’ On 19 July 2002, the
Council adopted a framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings (OJ L 203/1) whose Article 1
defines in detail the offences concerning trafficking in human beings for the purposes of labour exploitation or
sexual exploitation, which the Member States must make punishable by virtue of that framework decision.

TITLE II
FREEDOMS
Article 6 (1)
Right to liberty and security
Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.
Explanation
The rights in Article 6 (1) are the rights guaranteed by Article 5 of the ECHR, and in accordance with Article 52(3) of
the Charter (2), they have the same meaning and scope. Consequently, the limitations which may legitimately be
imposed on them may not exceed those permitted by the ECHR, in the wording of Article 5:
‘1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the
following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:
(a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court;
(b) the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non-compliance with the lawful order of a court or in order to
secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law;
(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal
authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered
necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;
(d) the detention of a minor by lawful order for the purpose of educational supervision or his lawful detention for
the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority;
(e) the lawful detention of persons for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases, of persons of
unsound mind, alcoholics or drug addicts or vagrants;
(f) the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of
a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.
2. Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his
arrest and of any charge against him.
3. Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1(c) of this Article shall be brought
promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial
within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.
(1) Article II-66 of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-112(3) of the Constitution.
Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 437
954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450 13-01-2005 08:14 Pagina 437
4. Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the
lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.
5. Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall
have an enforceable right to compensation.’
The rights enshrined in Article 6 (1) must be respected particularly when the European Parliament
and the Council adopt laws and framework laws in the area of judicial cooperation in criminal
matters, on the basis of Articles III-270, III-271 and III-273 of the Constitution, notably to define
common minimum provisions as regards the categorisation of offences and punishments and certain
aspects of procedural law.
Article 7 (2)
Respect for private and family life
Everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications.
Explanation
The rights guaranteed in Article 7 (2) correspond to those guaranteed by Article 8 of the ECHR. To take account of
developments in technology the word ‘correspondence’ has been replaced by ‘communications’.
In accordance with Article 52(3) (3), the meaning and scope of this right are the same as those of the corresponding
article of the ECHR. Consequently, the limitations which may legitimately be imposed on this right are the same as
those allowed by Article 8 of the ECHR:
‘1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.
2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance
with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the
economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals,
or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.’
(1) Article II-66 of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-67 of the Constitution.

Article 8 (1)
Protection of personal data
1. Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.
2. Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the
person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law. Everyone has the right of access to
data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified.
3. Compliance with these rules shall be subject to control by an independent authority.
Explanation
This Article has been based on Article 286 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and Directive 95/46/EC
of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of
personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 281, 23.11.1995) as well as on Article 8 of the ECHR and on
the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic
Processing of Personal Data, which has been ratified by all the Member States. Article 286 of the EC Treaty is now
replaced by Article I-51 of the Constitution. Reference is also made to Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the
Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 8, 12.1.2001). The abovementioned
Directive and Regulation contain conditions and limitations for the exercise of the right to the protection of personal
data.
Article 9 (2)
Right to marry and right to found a family
The right to marry and the right to found a family shall be guaranteed in accordance with the
national laws governing the exercise of these rights.
Explanation
This Article is based on Article 12 of the ECHR, which reads as follows: ‘Men and women of marriageable age have the
right to marry and to found a family according to the national laws governing the exercising of this right.’ The wording
of the Article has been modernised to cover cases in which national legislation recognises arrangements other than
marriage for founding a family. This Article neither prohibits nor imposes the granting of the status of marriage to
unions between people of the same sex. This right is thus similar to that afforded by the ECHR, but its scope may be
wider when national legislation so provides.
(1) Article II-68 of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-69 of the Constitution.
Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 439
954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450 13-01-2005 08:14 Pagina 439
Article 10 (1)
Freedom of thought, conscience and religion
1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right includes
freedom to change religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in
public or in private, to manifest religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.
2. The right to conscientious objection is recognised, in accordance with the national laws
governing the exercise of this right.
Explanation
The right guaranteed in paragraph 1 corresponds to the right guaranteed in Article 9 of the ECHR and, in accordance
with Article 52(3) of the Charter (2), has the same meaning and scope. Limitations must therefore respect Article 9(2) of
the Convention, which reads as follows: ‘Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such
limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the
protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.’
The right guaranteed in paragraph 2 corresponds to national constitutional traditions and to the development of
national legislation on this issue.
Article 11 (3)
Freedom of expression and information
1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold
opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority
and regardless of frontiers.
2. The freedom and pluralism of the media shall be respected.
Explanation
1. Article 11 (3) corresponds to Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which reads as follows:
‘1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive
and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article
shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.
(1) Article II-70 of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-112(3) of the Constitution.
(3) Article II-71 of the Constitution.
440 Final act
954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450 13-01-2005 08:14 Pagina 440
2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities,
conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the
interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the
protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure
of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.’
Pursuant to Article 52(3) of the Charter (1), the meaning and scope of this right are the same as those guaranteed by the
ECHR. The limitations which may be imposed on it may therefore not exceed those provided for in Article 10(2) of the
Convention, without prejudice to any restrictions which competition law of the Union may impose on Member States'
right to introduce the licensing arrangements referred to in the third sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECHR.
2. Paragraph 2 of this Article spells out the consequences of paragraph 1 regarding freedom of the media. It is based
in particular on Court of Justice case-law regarding television, particularly in case C-288/89 (judgment of 25 July 1991,
Stichting Collectieve Antennevoorziening Gouda and others [1991] ECR I-4007), and on the Protocol on the system of
public broadcasting in the Member States annexed to the EC Treaty and now to the Constitution, and on Council
Directive 89/552/EC (particularly its seventeenth recital).
Article 12 (2)
Freedom of assembly and of association
1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association at all
levels, in particular in political, trade union and civic matters, which implies the right of everyone to
form and to join trade unions for the protection of his or her interests.
2. Political parties at Union level contribute to expressing the political will of the citizens of the
Union.
Explanation
1. Paragraph 1 of this Article corresponds to Article 11 of the ECHR, which reads as follows:
‘1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the
right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.
2. No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are
necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder
or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This
article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the
armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.’
(1) Article II-112(3) of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-72 of the Constitution.
Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 441
954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450 13-01-2005 08:14 Pagina 441
The meaning of the provisions of paragraph 1 is the same as that of the ECHR, but their scope is wider since they apply
at all levels including European level. In accordance with Article 52(3) of the Charter (1), limitations on that right may
not exceed those considered legitimate by virtue of Article 11(2) of the ECHR.
2. This right is also based on Article 11 of the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social
Rights of Workers.
3. Paragraph 2 of this Article corresponds to Article I-46(4) of the Constitution.
Article 13 (2)
Freedom of the arts and sciences
The arts and scientific research shall be free of constraint. Academic freedom shall be respected.
Explanation
This right is deduced primarily from the right to freedom of thought and expression. It is to be exercised having regard
to Article 1 (3) and may be subject to the limitations authorised by Article 10 of the ECHR.
Article 14 (4)
Right to education
1. Everyone has the right to education and to have access to vocational and continuing training.
2. This right includes the possibility to receive free compulsory education.
3. The freedom to found educational establishments with due respect for democratic principles and
the right of parents to ensure the education and teaching of their children in conformity with their
religious, philosophical and pedagogical convictions shall be respected, in accordance with the
national laws governing the exercise of such freedom and right.
Explanation
1. This Article is based on the common constitutional traditions of Member States and on Article 2 of the Protocol to
the ECHR, which reads as follows:
‘No person shall be denied the right to education. In the exercise of any functions which it assumes in relation to
education and to teaching, the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such education and teaching in
conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions.’
(1) Article II-112(3) of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-73 of the Constitution.
(3) Article II-61 of the Constitution.
(4) Article II-74 of the Constitution.
442 Final act
954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450 13-01-2005 08:14 Pagina 442
It was considered useful to extend this article to access to vocational and continuing training (see point 15 of the
Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers and Article 10 of the Social Charter) and to add
the principle of free compulsory education. As it is worded, the latter principle merely implies that as regards
compulsory education, each child has the possibility of attending an establishment which offers free education. It
does not require all establishments which provide education or vocational and continuing training, in particular
private ones, to be free of charge. Nor does it exclude certain specific forms of education having to be paid for, if
the State takes measures to grant financial compensation. Insofar as the Charter applies to the Union, this means
that in its training policies the Union must respect free compulsory education, but this does not, of course, create
new powers. Regarding the right of parents, it must be interpreted in conjunction with the provisions of
Article 24 (1).
2. Freedom to found public or private educational establishments is guaranteed as one of the aspects of freedom to
conduct a business but it is limited by respect for democratic principles and is exercised in accordance with the
arrangements defined by national legislation.
Article 15 (2)
Freedom to choose an occupation and right to engage in work
1. Everyone has the right to engage in work and to pursue a freely chosen or accepted occupation.
2. Every citizen of the Union has the freedom to seek employment, to work, to exercise the right of
establishment and to provide services in any Member State.
3. Nationals of third countries who are authorised to work in the territories of the Member States
are entitled to working conditions equivalent to those of citizens of the Union.
Explanation
Freedom to choose an occupation, as enshrined in Article 15(1) (2), is recognised in Court of Justice case-law (see inter
alia judgment of 14 May 1974, Case 4/73 Nold [1974] ECR 491, paragraphs 12 to 14 of the grounds; judgment of
13 December 1979, Case 44/79 Hauer [1979] ECR 3727; judgment of 8 October 1986, Case 234/85 Keller [1986]
ECR 2897, paragraph 8 of the grounds).
This paragraph also draws upon Article 1(2) of the European Social Charter, which was signed on 18 October 1961 and
has been ratified by all the Member States, and on point 4 of the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights
of Workers of 9 December 1989. The expression ‘working conditions’ is to be understood in the sense of Article III-213
of the Constitution.
Paragraph 2 deals with the three freedoms guaranteed by Articles I-4 and III-133, III-137 and III-144 of the
Constitution, namely freedom of movement for workers, freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services.
Paragraph 3 has been based on TEC Article 137(3), fourth indent, now replaced by Article III-210(1)(g) of the
Constitution, and on Article 19(4) of the European Social Charter signed on 18 October 1961 and ratified by all the
(1) Article II-84 of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-75 of the Constitution.

Member States. Article 52(2) of the Charter (1) is therefore applicable. The question of recruitment of seamen having the
nationality of third States for the crews of vessels flying the flag of a Member State of the Union is governed by Union
law and national legislation and practice.
Article 16 (2)
Freedom to conduct a business
The freedom to conduct a business in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices is
recognised.
Explanation
This Article is based on Court of Justice case-law which has recognised freedom to exercise an economic or commercial
activity (see judgments of 14 May 1974, Case 4/73 Nold [1974] ECR 491, paragraph 14 of the grounds, and of
27 September 1979, Case 230-78 SPA Eridiana and others [1979] ECR 2749, paragraphs 20 and 31 of the grounds) and
freedom of contract (see inter alia Sukkerfabriken Nykøbing judgment, Case 151/78 [1979] ECR 1, paragraph 19 of the
grounds, and judgment of 5 October 1999, C-240/97 Spain v Commission, [1999] ECR I-6571, paragraph 99 of the
grounds) and Article I-3(2) of the Constitution, which recognises free competition. Of course, this right is to be
exercised with respect for Union law and national legislation. It may be subject to the limitations provided for in
Article 52(1) of the Charter (3).
Article 17 (4)
Right to property
1. Everyone has the right to own, use, dispose of and bequeath his or her lawfully acquired
possessions. No one may be deprived of his or her possessions, except in the public interest and in
the cases and under the conditions provided for by law, subject to fair compensation being paid in
good time for their loss. The use of property may be regulated by law insofar as is necessary for the
general interest.
2. Intellectual property shall be protected.
Explanation
This Article is based on Article 1 of the Protocol to the ECHR:
‘Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his
possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles
of international law.
The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems
necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or
other contributions or penalties.’
(1) Article II-112(2) of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-76 of the Constitution.
(3) Article II-112(1) of the Constitution.
(4) Article II-77 of the Constitution.
444 Final act
954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450 13-01-2005 08:14 Pagina 444
This is a fundamental right common to all national constitutions. It has been recognised on numerous occasions by the
case-law of the Court of Justice, initially in the Hauer judgment (13 December 1979, ECR [1979] 3727). The wording
has been updated but, in accordance with Article 52(3) (1), the meaning and scope of the right are the same as those of
the right guaranteed by the ECHR and the limitations may not exceed those provided for there.
Protection of intellectual property, one aspect of the right of property, is explicitly mentioned in paragraph 2 because of
its growing importance and Community secondary legislation. Intellectual property covers not only literary and artistic
property but also inter alia patent and trademark rights and associated rights. The guarantees laid down in paragraph 1
shall apply as appropriate to intellectual property.
Article 18 (2)
Right to asylum
The right to asylum shall be guaranteed with due respect for the rules of the Geneva Convention of
28 July 1951 and the Protocol of 31 January 1967 relating to the status of refugees and in accordance
with the Constitution.
Explanation
The text of the Article has been based on TEC Article 63, now replaced by Article III-266 of the Constitution, which
requires the Union to respect the Geneva Convention on refugees. Reference should be made to the Protocols relating to
the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the [Treaty of Amsterdam] Constitution and to Denmark to determine the
extent to which those Member States implement Union law in this area and the extent to which this Article is applicable
to them. This Article is in line with the Protocol on Asylum annexed to the Constitution.
Article 19 (3)
Protection in the event of removal, expulsion or extradition
1. Collective expulsions are prohibited.
2. No one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or
she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment.
Explanation
Paragraph 1 of this Article has the same meaning and scope as Article 4 of Protocol 4 to the ECHR concerning
collective expulsion. Its purpose is to guarantee that every decision is based on a specific examination and that no single
measure can be taken to expel all persons having the nationality of a particular State (see also Article 13 of the Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights).
Paragraph 2 incorporates the relevant case-law from the European Court of Human Rights regarding Article 3 of the
ECHR (see Ahmed v Austria, judgment of 17 December 1996, [1996] ECR VI-2206 and Soering, judgment of 7 July
1989).

TITLE III
EQUALITY
Article 20 (1)
Equality before the law
Everyone is equal before the law.
Explanation
This Article corresponds to a general principle of law which is included in all European constitutions and has also been
recognised by the Court of Justice as a basic principle of Community law (judgment of 13 November 1984, Case 283/
83 Racke [1984] ECR 3791, judgment of 17 April 1997, Case 15/95 EARL [1997] ECR I-1961, and judgment of
13 April 2000, Case 292/97 Karlsson [2000] ECR 2737).
Article 21 (2)
Non-discrimination
1. Any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic
features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national
minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.
2. Within the scope of application of the Constitution and without prejudice to any of its specific
provisions, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.
Explanation
Paragraph 1 draws on Article 13 of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article III-124 of the Constitution, Article 14 of the
ECHR and Article 11 of the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine as regards genetic heritage. Insofar as this
corresponds to Article 14 of the ECHR, it applies in compliance with it.
There is no contradiction or incompatibility between paragraph 1 and Article III-124 of the Constitution which has a
different scope and purpose: Article III-124 confers power on the Union to adopt legislative acts, including
harmonisation of the Member States' laws and regulations, to combat certain forms of discrimination, listed
exhaustively in that Article. Such legislation may cover action of Member State authorities (as well as relations between
private individuals) in any area within the limits of the Union's powers. In contrast, the provision in paragraph 1 does
not create any power to enact anti-discrimination laws in these areas of Member State or private action, nor does it lay
down a sweeping ban of discrimination in such wide-ranging areas. Instead, it only addresses discriminations by the
institutions and bodies of the Union themselves, when exercising powers conferred under other articles of Parts I and III
(1) Article II-80 of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-81 of the Constitution.
446 Final act
954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450 13-01-2005 08:14 Pagina 446
of the Constitution, and by Member States only when they are implementing Union law. Paragraph 1 therefore does not
alter the extent of powers granted under Article III-124 nor the interpretation given to that Article.
Paragraph 2 corresponds to Article I-4(2) of the Constitution and must be applied in compliance with that Article.
Article 22 (1)
Cultural, religious and linguistic diversity
The Union shall respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.
Explanation
This Article has been based on Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and on Article 151(1) and (4) of the EC
Treaty, now replaced by Article III-280(1) and (4) of the Constitution, concerning culture. Respect for cultural and
linguistic diversity is now also laid down in Article I-3(3) of the Constitution. The Article is also inspired by Declaration
No 11 to the Final Act of the Amsterdam Treaty on the status of churches and non-confessional organisations, now
taken over in Article I-52 of the Constitution.
Article 23 (2)
Equality between women and men
Equality between women and men must be ensured in all areas, including employment, work and
pay.
The principle of equality shall not prevent the maintenance or adoption of measures providing for
specific advantages in favour of the under-represented sex.
Explanation
The first paragraph has been based on Articles 2 and 3(2) of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Articles I-3 and III-116 of
the Constitution which impose the objective of promoting equality between men and women on the Union, and on
Article 141(1) of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article III-214(1) of the Constitution. It draws on Article 20 of the
revised European Social Charter of 3 May 1996 and on point 16 of the Community Charter on the rights of workers.
It is also based on Article 141(3) of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article III-214(3) of the Constitution, and Article 2
(4) of Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as
regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions.
The second paragraph takes over in shorter form Article III-214(4) of the Constitution which provides that the principle
of equal treatment does not prevent the maintenance or adoption of measures providing for specific advantages in order
to make it easier for the under-represented sex to pursue a vocational activity or to prevent or compensate for
(1) Article II-82 of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-83 of the Constitution.

disadvantages in professional careers. In accordance with Article 52(2) (1), the present paragraph does not amend
Article III-214(4).
Article 24 (2)
The rights of the child
1. Children shall have the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their well-being. They
may express their views freely. Such views shall be taken into consideration on matters which
concern them in accordance with their age and maturity.
2. In all actions relating to children, whether taken by public authorities or private institutions, the
child's best interests must be a primary consideration.
3. Every child shall have the right to maintain on a regular basis a personal relationship and direct
contact with both his or her parents, unless that is contrary to his or her interests.
Explanation
This Article is based on the New York Convention on the Rights of the Child signed on 20 November 1989 and ratified
by all the Member States, particularly Articles 3, 9, 12 and 13 thereof.
Paragraph 3 takes account of the fact that, as part of the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, Union
legislation on civil matters having cross-border implications, for which Article III-269 of the Constitution confers
power, may include notably visiting rights ensuring that children can maintain on a regular basis a personal and direct
contact with both his or her parents.
Article 25 (3)
The rights of the elderly
The Union recognises and respects the rights of the elderly to lead a life of dignity and independence
and to participate in social and cultural life.
Explanation
This Article draws on Article 23 of the revised European Social Charter and Articles 24 and 25 of the Community
Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers. Of course, participation in social and cultural life also covers
participation in political life.
(1) Article II-112(2) of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-84 of the Constitution.

Article 26 (1)
Integration of persons with disabilities
The Union recognises and respects the right of persons with disabilities to benefit from measures
designed to ensure their independence, social and occupational integration and participation in the
life of the community.
Explanation
The principle set out in this Article is based on Article 15 of the European Social Charter and also draws on point 26 of
the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers.
TITLE IV
SOLIDARITY
Article 27 (2)
Workers' right to information and consultation within the undertaking
Workers or their representatives must, at the appropriate levels, be guaranteed information and
consultation in good time in the cases and under the conditions provided for by Union law and
national laws and practices.
Explanation
This Article appears in the revised European Social Charter (Article 21) and in the Community Charter on the rights of
workers (points 17 and 18). It applies under the conditions laid down by Union law and by national laws. The reference
to appropriate levels refers to the levels laid down by Union law or by national laws and practices, which might include
the European level when Union legislation so provides. There is a considerable Union acquis in this field: Articles III-211
and III-212 of the Constitution, and Directives 2002/14/EC (general framework for informing and consulting employees
in the European Community), 98/59/EC (collective redundancies), 2001/23/EC (transfers of undertakings) and
94/45/EC (European works councils).
Article 28 (3)
Right of collective bargaining and action
Workers and employers, or their respective organisations, have, in accordance with Union law and
national laws and practices, the right to negotiate and conclude collective agreements at the
appropriate levels and, in cases of conflicts of interest, to take collective action to defend their
interests, including strike action.

Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 449
954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450 13-01-2005 08:14 Pagina 449
Explanation
This Article is based on Article 6 of the European Social Charter and on the Community Charter of the Fundamental
Social Rights of Workers (points 12 to 14). The right of collective action was recognised by the European Court of
Human Rights as one of the elements of trade union rights laid down by Article 11 of the ECHR. As regards the
appropriate levels at which collective negotiation might take place, see the explanation given for the above Article. The
modalities and limits for the exercise of collective action, including strike action, come under national laws and
practices, including the question of whether it may be carried out in parallel in several Member States.
Article 29 (1)

Protection in the event of unjustified dismissal
Every worker has the right to protection against unjustified dismissal, in accordance with Union law

improvements in the safety and health of workers at work. It also draws on Article 3 of the Social Charter and point 19
of the Community Charter on the rights of workers, and, as regards dignity at work, on Article 26 of the revised Social
Charter. The expression ‘working conditions’ must be understood in the sense of Article III-213 of the Constitution.
2. Paragraph 2 is based on Directive 93/104/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time,
Article 2 of the European Social Charter and point 8 of the Community Charter on the rights of workers.
Article 32 (1)

The employment of children is prohibited. The minimum age of admission to employment may not
be lower than the minimum school-leaving age, without prejudice to such rules as may be more
favourable to young people and except for limited derogations.
Young people admitted to work must have working conditions appropriate to their age and be
protected against economic exploitation and any work likely to harm their safety, health or physical,
mental, moral or social development or to interfere with their education.

Charter and points 20 to 23 of the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers.
Article 33 (2)
Family and professional life

Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 451
954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450 13-01-2005 08:14 Pagina 451
The second paragraph draws on Council Directive 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage
improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are
breastfeeding and Directive 96/34/EC on the framework agreement on parental leave concluded by UNICE, CEEP and
the ETUC. It is also based on Article 8 (protection of maternity) of the European Social Charter and draws on Article 27
(right of workers with family responsibilities to equal opportunities and equal treatment) of the revised Social Charter.
‘Maternity’ covers the period from conception to weaning.
Article 34 (1)
Social security and social assistance
1. The Union recognises and respects the entitlement to social security benefits and social services
providing protection in cases such as maternity, illness, industrial accidents, dependency or old age,

2. Everyone residing and moving legally within the European Union is entitled to social security
benefits and social advantages in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices.
3. In order to combat social exclusion and poverty, the Union recognises and respects the right to
social and housing assistance so as to ensure a decent existence for all those who lack sufficient
resources, in accordance with the rules laid down by Union law and national laws and practices.
Explanation
The principle set out in Article 34(1) (1) is based on Articles 137 and 140 of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Articles III-
210 and III-213 and on Article 12 of the European Social Charter and point 10 of the Community Charter on the rights
of workers. The Union must respect it when exercising the powers conferred on it by Articles III-210 and III-213 of the
Constitution. The reference to social services relates to cases in which such services have been introduced to provide
certain advantages but does not imply that such services must be created where they do not exist. ‘Maternity’ must be
understood in the same sense as in the preceding Article.
Paragraph 2 is based on Articles 12(4) and 13(4) of the European Social Charter and point 2 of the Community Charter
of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers and reflects the rules arising from Regulation No 1408/71 and Regulation
No 1612/68.
Paragraph 3 draws on Article 13 of the European Social Charter and Articles 30 and 31 of the revised Social Charter

the principle of respect by the Union for the access to services of general economic interest as provided for by national
provisions, when those provisions are compatible with Union law.

secret ballot.
Explanation
Article 39 (2) applies under the conditions laid down in Parts I and III of the Constitution, in accordance with Article 52

Explanation
This Article corresponds to the right guaranteed by Article I-10(2) of the Constitution (see also the legal base in
Article III-126 for the adoption of detailed arrangements for the exercise of that right). In accordance with Article 52(2)
of the Charter (1), it applies under the conditions set out in these Articles of Parts I and III of the Constitution.
Article 41 (2)
Right to good administration
1. Every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a
reasonable time by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union.
2. This right includes:
(a) the right of every person to be heard, before any individual measure which would affect him or
her adversely is taken;
(b) the right of every person to have access to his or her file, while respecting the legitimate interests

4. Every person may write to the institutions of the Union in one of the languages of
the Constitution and must have an answer in the same language.
Explanation
Article 41 (2) is based on the existence of the Union as subject to the rule of law whose characteristics were developed in
the case-law which enshrined, inter alia, good administration as a general principle of law (see, inter alia, Court of Justice
judgment of 31 March 1992 in Case C-255/90 P, Burban [1992] ECR I-2253, and Court of First Instance judgments of
18 September 1995 in Case T-167/94 Nölle [1995] ECR II-2589, and 9 July 1999 in Case T-231/97 New Europe
Consulting and others [1999] ECR II-2403). The wording for that right in the first two paragraphs results from the caselaw
(Court of Justice judgment of 15 October 1987 in Case 222/86 Heylens [1987] ECR 4097, paragraph 15 of the
grounds, judgment of 18 October 1989 in Case 374/87 Orkem [1989] ECR 3283, judgment of 21 November 1991 in
Case C-269/90 TU München [1991] ECR I-5469, and Court of First Instance judgments of 6 December 1994 in Case T-
450/93 Lisrestal [1994] ECR II-1177, 18 September 1995 in Case T-167/94 Nölle [1995] ECR II-258) and the wording
regarding the obligation to give reasons comes from Article 253 of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article I-38(2) of the
Constitution (see also the legal base in Article III-398 of the Constitution for the adoption of legislation in the interest
of an open, efficient and independent European administration).

the Union, whatever their medium.
Explanation
The right guaranteed in this Article has been taken over from Article 255 of the EC Treaty, on the basis of which
Regulation 1049/2001 has subsequently been adopted. The European Convention has extended this right to documents
of institutions, bodies and agencies generally, regardless of their form, see Article I-50(3) of the Constitution. In
accordance with Article 52(2) of the Charter (1), the right of access to documents is exercised under the conditions and
within the limits for which provision is made in Articles I-50(3) and III-399.
Article 43 (4)
European Ombudsman
Any citizen of the Union and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a
Member State has the right to refer to the European Ombudsman cases of maladministration in the
activities of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union, with the exception of the Court
of Justice of the European Union acting in its judicial role.
Explanation
The right guaranteed in this Article is the right guaranteed by Articles I-10 and III-335 of the Constitution. In
accordance with Article 52(2) of the Charter (1), it applies under the conditions defined in these two Articles.

Article 45 (3)
Freedom of movement and of residence
1. Every citizen of the Union has the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the
Member States.
2. Freedom of movement and residence may be granted, in accordance with the Constitution, to
nationals of third countries legally resident in the territory of a Member State.
Explanation
The right guaranteed by paragraph 1 is the right guaranteed by Article I-10(2)(a) of the Constitution (cf. also the legal
base in Article III-125; and the judgement of the Court of Justice of 17 September 2002, C-413/99 Baumbast, [2002]
ECR 709). In accordance with Article 52(2) of the Charter (2), it applies under the conditions and within the limits
defined for which provision is made in Part III of the Constitution.
Paragraph 2 refers to the power granted to the Union by Articles III-265 to III-267 of the Constitution. Consequently,
the granting of this right depends on the institutions exercising that power.
Article 46 (4)
Diplomatic and consular protection
Every citizen of the Union shall, in the territory of a third country in which the Member State of
which he or she is a national is not represented, be entitled to protection by the diplomatic or
consular authorities of any Member State, on the same conditions as the nationals of that
Member State.

Explanation
The right guaranteed by this Article is the right guaranteed by Article I-10 of the Constitution; cf. also the legal base in
Article III-127. In accordance with Article 52(2) of the Charter (1), it applies under the conditions defined in these
Articles.
TITLE VI
JUSTICE
Article 47 (2)
Right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial
Everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the Union are violated has the right to
an effective remedy before a tribunal in compliance with the conditions laid down in this Article.
Everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and
impartial tribunal previously established by law. Everyone shall have the possibility of being advised,
defended and represented.
Legal aid shall be made available to those who lack sufficient resources insofar as such aid is necessary
to ensure effective access to justice.
Explanation
The first paragraph is based on Article 13 of the ECHR:
‘Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a
national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.’
However, in Union law the protection is more extensive since it guarantees the right to an effective remedy before a
court. The Court of Justice enshrined that right in its judgment of 15 May 1986 as a general principle of Union law
(Case 222/84 Johnston [1986] ECR 1651; see also judgment of 15 October 1987, Case 222/86 Heylens [1987]
ECR 4097 and judgment of 3 December 1992, Case C-97/91 Borelli [1992] ECR I-6313). According to the Court, that
general principle of Union law also applies to the Member States when they are implementing Union law. The inclusion
of this precedent in the Charter has not been intended to change the system of judicial review laid down by the Treaties,
and particularly the rules relating to admissibility for direct actions before the Court of Justice of the European Union.
The European Convention has considered the Union's system of judicial review including the rules on admissibility, and
confirmed them while amending them as to certain aspects, as reflected in Articles III-353 to III-381 of the
Constitution, and in particular in Article III-365(4). Article 47 (2) applies to the institutions of the Union and of
Member States when they are implementing Union law and does so for all rights guaranteed by Union law.
(1) Article II-112(2) of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-107 of the Constitution.
458 Final act
954393_TRAITE_EN_451_481 13-01-2005 09:18 Pagina 458
The second paragraph corresponds to Article 6(1) of the ECHR which reads as follows:
‘In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a
fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment
shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of
morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the
private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special
circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice.’
In Union law, the right to a fair hearing is not confined to disputes relating to civil law rights and obligations. That is
one of the consequences of the fact that the Union is a community based on the rule of law as stated by the Court in
Case 294/83, ‘Les Verts’ v European Parliament (judgment of 23 April 1986, [1988] ECR 1339). Nevertheless, in all
respects other than their scope, the guarantees afforded by the ECHR apply in a similar way to the Union.
With regard to the third paragraph, it should be noted that in accordance with the case-law of the European Court of
Human Rights, provision should be made for legal aid where the absence of such aid would make it impossible to
ensure an effective remedy (ECHR Judgment of 9 October 1979, Airey, Series A, Volume 32, 11). There is also a system
of legal assistance for cases before the Court of Justice of the European Union.
Article 48 (1)
Presumption of innocence and right of defence
1. Everyone who has been charged shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.
2. Respect for the rights of the defence of anyone who has been charged shall be guaranteed.
Explanation
Article 48 (1) is the same as Article 6(2) and (3) of the ECHR, which reads as follows:
‘2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.
3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and
cause of the accusation against him;
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;
(1) Article II-108 of the Constitution.
Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 459
954393_TRAITE_EN_451_481 13-01-2005 09:18 Pagina 459
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not
sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so
require;
(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and
examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him;
(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in
court.’
In accordance with Article 52(3) (1), this right has the same meaning and scope as the right
guaranteed by the ECHR.
Article 49 (2)
Principles of legality and proportionality of criminal offences and penalties
1. No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did
not constitute a criminal offence under national law or international law at the time when it was
committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than that which was applicable at the time the
criminal offence was committed. If, subsequent to the commission of a criminal offence, the law
provides for a lighter penalty, that penalty shall be applicable.
2. This Article shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission
which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles
recognised by the community of nations.
3. The severity of penalties must not be disproportionate to the criminal offence.
Explanation
This Article follows the traditional rule of the non-retroactivity of laws and criminal sanctions. There has been added
the rule of the retroactivity of a more lenient penal law, which exists in a number of Member States and which features
in Article 15 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Article 7 of the ECHR is worded as follows:
‘1. No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a
criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty
be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.
2. This Article shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time
when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations.’
(1) Article II-112(3) of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-109 of the Constitution.
460 Final act
954393_TRAITE_EN_451_481 13-01-2005 09:18 Pagina 460
In paragraph 2, the reference to ‘civilised’ nations has been deleted; this does not change the meaning of this
paragraph, which refers to crimes against humanity in particular. In accordance with Article 52(3) (1), the right
guaranteed here therefore has the same meaning and scope as the right guaranteed by the ECHR.
Paragraph 3 states the general principle of proportionality between penalties and criminal offences which is
enshrined in the common constitutional traditions of the Member States and in the case-law of the Court of Justice
of the Communities.
Article 50 (2)
Right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings for the same criminal offence
No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings for an offence for which
he or she has already been finally acquitted or convicted within the Union in accordance with the law.
Explanation
Article 4 of Protocol No 7 to the ECHR reads as follows:
‘1. No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings under the jurisdiction of the same State
for an offence for which he has already been finally acquitted or convicted in accordance with the law and penal
procedure of that State.
2. The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not prevent the reopening of the case in accordance with the law
and the penal procedure of the State concerned, if there is evidence of new or newly discovered facts, or if there has
been a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings, which could affect the outcome of the case.
3. No derogation from this Article shall be made under Article 15 of the Convention.’
The ‘non bis in idem’ rule applies in Union law (see, among the many precedents, the judgment of 5 May 1966, Cases
18/65 and 35/65, Gutmann v Commission [1966] ECR 103 and a recent case, the decision of the Court of First
Instance of 20 April 1999, Joined Cases T-305/94 and others, Limburgse Vinyl Maatschappij NV v. Commission [1999]
ECR II-931). The rule prohibiting cumulation refers to cumulation of two penalties of the same kind, that is to say
criminal law penalties.
In accordance with Article 50 (2), the ‘non bis in idem’ rule applies not only within the jurisdiction of one State but also
between the jurisdictions of several Member States. That corresponds to the acquis in Union law; see Articles 54 to 58 of
the Schengen Convention and the judgment of the Court of Justice of 11 February 2003, C-187/01 Gözütok (not yet
published), Article 7 of the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests and
Article 10 of the Convention on the fight against corruption. The very limited exceptions in those Conventions
permitting the Member States to derogate from the ‘non bis in idem’ rule are covered by the horizontal clause in
Article 52(1) of the Charter (3) concerning limitations. As regards the situations referred to by Article 4 of Protocol
No 7, namely the application of the principle within the same Member State, the guaranteed right has the same meaning
and the same scope as the corresponding right in the ECHR.

TITLE VII
GENERAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF THE CHARTER
Article 51 (1)
Field of application
1. The provisions of this Charter are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of
the Union with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and to the Member States only when they
are implementing Union law. They shall therefore respect the rights, observe the principles and
promote the application thereof in accordance with their respective powers and respecting the limits
of the powers of the Union as conferred on it in the other Parts of the Constitution.
2. This Charter does not extend the field of application of Union law beyond the powers of
the Union or establish any new power or task for the Union, or modify powers and tasks defined in
the other Parts of the Constitution.
Explanation
The aim of Article 51 (1) is to determine the scope of the Charter. It seeks to establish clearly that the Charter applies
primarily to the institutions and bodies of the Union, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity. This provision
was drafted in keeping with Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union, which required the Union to respect
fundamental rights, and with the mandate issued by Cologne European Council. The term ‘institutions’ is enshrined in
Part I of the Constitution. The expression ‘bodies, offices and agencies’ is commonly used in the Constitution to refer to
all the authorities set up by the Constitution or by secondary legislation (see, e.g., Articles I-50 or I-51 of the
Constitution).
As regards the Member States, it follows unambiguously from the case-law of the Court of Justice that the requirement
to respect fundamental rights defined in a Union context is only binding on the Member States when they act in the
scope of Union law (judgment of 13 July 1989, Case 5/88 Wachauf [1989] ECR 2609; judgment of 18 June 1991, ERT
[1991] ECR I-2925); judgment of 18 December 1997 (C-309/96 Annibaldi [1997] ECR I-7493). The Court of Justice
confirmed this case-law in the following terms: ‘In addition, it should be remembered that the requirements flowing
from the protection of fundamental rights in the Community legal order are also binding on Member States when they
implement Community rules ...’ (judgment of 13 April 2000, Case C-292/97, [2000] ECR 2737, paragraph 37 of the
grounds). Of course this rule, as enshrined in this Charter, applies to the central authorities as well as to regional or local
bodies, and to public organisations, when they are implementing Union law.
Paragraph 2, together with the second sentence of paragraph 1, confirms that the Charter may not have the effect of
extending the competences and tasks which the other Parts of the Constitution confer on the Union. Explicit mention is
made here of the logical consequences of the principle of subsidiarity and of the fact that the Union only has those
powers which have been conferred upon it. The fundamental rights as guaranteed in the Union do not have any effect
other than in the context of the powers determined by Parts I and III of the Constitution. Consequently, an obligation,
pursuant to the second sentence of paragraph 1, for the Union's institutions to promote principles laid down in the
Charter, may arise only within the limits of these same powers.
(1) Article II-111 of the Constitution.
462 Final act
954393_TRAITE_EN_451_481 13-01-2005 09:18 Pagina 462
Paragraph 2 also confirms that the Charter may not have the effect of extending the field of application of Union law
beyond the powers of the Union as established in the other Parts of the Constitution. The Court of Justice has already
established this rule with respect to the fundamental rights recognised as part of Union law (judgment of 17 February
1998, C-249/96 Grant, 1998 ECR I-621, paragraph 45 of the grounds). In accordance with this rule, it goes without
saying that the incorporation of the Charter into the Constitution cannot be understood as extending by itself the range
of Member State action considered to be ‘implementation of Union law’ (within the meaning of paragraph 1 and the
above-mentioned case-law).
Article 52 (1)
Scope and interpretation of rights and principles
1. Any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by this Charter must be
provided for by law and respect the essence of those rights and freedoms. Subject to the principle of
proportionality, limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of
general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.
2. Rights recognised by this Charter for which provision is made in other Parts of the Constitution
shall be exercised under the conditions and within the limits defined by these relevant Parts.
3. Insofar as this Charter contains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the Convention
for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the meaning and scope of those
rights shall be the same as those laid down by the said Convention. This provision shall not prevent
Union law providing more extensive protection.
4. Insofar as this Charter recognises fundamental rights as they result from the constitutional
traditions common to the Member States, those rights shall be interpreted in harmony with those
traditions.
5. The provisions of this Charter which contain principles may be implemented by legislative and
executive acts taken by institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, and by acts of
Member States when they are implementing Union law, in the exercise of their respective powers.
They shall be judicially cognisable only in the interpretation of such acts and in the ruling on their
legality.
6. Full account shall be taken of national laws and practices as specified in this Charter.
7. The explanations drawn up as a way of providing guidance in the interpretation of the Charter of
Fundamental Rights shall be given due regard by the courts of the Union and of the Member States.
(1) Article II-112 of the Constitution.
Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 463
954393_TRAITE_EN_451_481 13-01-2005 09:18 Pagina 463
Explanation
The purpose of Article 52 (1) is to set the scope of the rights and principles of the Charter, and to lay down rules for
their interpretation. Paragraph 1 deals with the arrangements for the limitation of rights. The wording is based on the
case-law of the Court of Justice: ‘... it is well established in the case-law of the Court that restrictions may be imposed on
the exercise of fundamental rights, in particular in the context of a common organisation of the market, provided that
those restrictions in fact correspond to objectives of general interest pursued by the Community and do not constitute,
with regard to the aim pursued, disproportionate and unreasonable interference undermining the very substance of
those rights’ (judgment of 13 April 2000, Case C-292/97, paragraph 45 of the grounds). The reference to general
interests recognised by the Union covers both the objectives mentioned in Article I-2 of the Constitution and other
interests protected by specific provisions of the Constitution such as Articles I-5(1), III-133(3), III-154 and III-436.
Paragraph 2 refers to rights which were already expressly guaranteed in the Treaty establishing the European
Community and have been recognised in the Charter, and which are now found in other Parts of the Constitution
(notably the rights derived from Union citizenship). It clarifies that such rights remain subject to the conditions and
limits applicable to the Union law on which they are based, and for which provision is now made in Parts I and III of the
Constitution. The Charter does not alter the system of rights conferred by the EC Treaty and now taken over by Parts I
and III of the Constitution.
Paragraph 3 is intended to ensure the necessary consistency between the Charter and the ECHR by establishing the rule
that, insofar as the rights in the present Charter also correspond to rights guaranteed by the ECHR, the meaning and
scope of those rights, including authorised limitations, are the same as those laid down by the ECHR. This means in
particular that the legislator, in laying down limitations to those rights, must comply with the same standards as are
fixed by the detailed limitation arrangements laid down in the ECHR, which are thus made applicable for the rights
covered by this paragraph, without thereby adversely affecting the autonomy of Union law and of that of the Court of
Justice of the European Union.
The reference to the ECHR covers both the Convention and the Protocols to it. The meaning and the scope of the
guaranteed rights are determined not only by the text of those instruments, but also by the case-law of the European
Court of Human Rights and by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The last sentence of the paragraph is
designed to allow the Union to guarantee more extensive protection. In any event, the level of protection afforded by
the Charter may never be lower than that guaranteed by the ECHR.
The Charter does not affect the possibilities of Member States to avail themselves of Article 15 ECHR, allowing
derogations from ECHR rights in the event of war or of other public dangers threatening the life of the nation, when
they take action in the areas of national defence in the event of war and of the maintenance of law and order, in
accordance with their responsibilities recognised in Articles I-5 (1), III-131, III-262 of the Constitution.
The list of rights which may at the present stage, without precluding developments in the law, legislation and the
Treaties, be regarded as corresponding to rights in the ECHR within the meaning of the present paragraph is given
hereafter. It does not include rights additional to those in the ECHR.
1. Articles of the Charter where both the meaning and the scope are the same as the corresponding Articles of the
ECHR:
— Article 2 (2) corresponds to Article 2 of the ECHR
(1) Article II-112 of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-62 of the Constitution.
464 Final act
954393_TRAITE_EN_451_481 13-01-2005 09:18 Pagina 464
— Article 4 (1) corresponds to Article 3 of the ECHR
— Article 5(1) and (2) (2) correspond to Article 4 of the ECHR
— Article 6 (3) corresponds to Article 5 of the ECHR
— Article 7 (4) corresponds to Article 8 of the ECHR
— Article 10(1) (5) corresponds to Article 9 of the ECHR
— Article 11 (6) corresponds to Article 10 of the ECHR without prejudice to any restrictions which Union law
may impose on Member States' right to introduce the licensing arrangements referred to in the third sentence
of Article 10(1) of the ECHR
— Article 17 (7) corresponds to Article 1 of the Protocol to the ECHR
— Article 19(1) (8) corresponds to Article 4 of Protocol No 4
— Article 19(2) (8) corresponds to Article 3 of the ECHR as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights
— Article 48 (9) corresponds to Article 6(2) and(3) of the ECHR
— Article 49(1) (with the exception of the last sentence) and (2) (10) correspond to Article 7 of the ECHR
2. Articles where the meaning is the same as the corresponding Articles of the ECHR, but where the scope is wider:
— Article 9 (11) covers the same field as Article 12 of the ECHR, but its scope may be extended to other forms of
marriage if these are established by national legislation

Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 465
954393_TRAITE_EN_451_481 13-01-2005 09:18 Pagina 465
— Article 12(1) (1) corresponds to Article 11 of the ECHR, but its scope is extended to European Union level
— Article 14(1) (2) corresponds to Article 2 of the Protocol to the ECHR, but its scope is extended to cover access
to vocational and continuing training
— Article 14(3) (2) corresponds to Article 2 of the Protocol to the ECHR as regards the rights of parents
— Article 47(2) and (3) (3) correspond to Article 6(1) of the ECHR, but the limitation to the determination of civil
rights and obligations or criminal charges does not apply as regards Union law and its implementation
— Article 50 (4) corresponds to Article 4 of Protocol No 7 to the ECHR, but its scope is extended to European
Union level between the Courts of the Member States.
— Finally, citizens of the European Union may not be considered as aliens in the scope of the application of
Union law, because of the prohibition of any discrimination on grounds of nationality. The limitations
provided for by Article 16 of the ECHR as regards the rights of aliens therefore do not apply to them in this
context.
The rule of interpretation contained in paragraph 4 has been based on the wording of Article 6(2) of the Treaty on
European Union (cf. now the wording of Article I-9(3) of the Constitution) and takes due account of the approach
to common constitutional traditions followed by the Court of Justice (e.g., judgment of 13 December 1979,
Case 44/79 Hauer [1979] ECR 3727; judgment of 18 May 1982, Case 155/79, AM&S, [1982] ECR 1575). Under
that rule, rather than following a rigid approach of ‘a lowest common denominator’, the Charter rights concerned
should be interpreted in a way offering a high standard of protection which is adequate for the law of the Union
and in harmony with the common constitutional traditions.
Paragraph 5 clarifies the distinction between ‘rights’ and ‘principles’ set out in the Charter. According to that
distinction, subjective rights shall be respected, whereas principles shall be observed (Article 51 (1)) (5). Principles
may be implemented through legislative or executive acts (adopted by the Union in accordance with its powers,
and by the Member States only when they implement Union law); accordingly, they become significant for the
Courts only when such acts are interpreted or reviewed. They do not however give rise to direct claims for positive
action by the Union's institutions or Member States authorities. This is consistent both with case-law of the Court
of Justice (Cf. notably case-law on the ‘precautionary principle’ in Article 174 (2) TEC (replaced by Article III-233 of
the Constitution): judgment of the CFI of 11 September 2002, T-13/99, Pfizer vs. Council, with numerous
references to earlier case-law; and a series of judgments on Article 33 (ex 39) on the principles of agricultural law,
e.g. judgment of the Court of Justice C-265/85, Van den Berg, 1987 ECR 1155: scrutiny of the principle of market
stabilisation and of reasonable expectations) and with the approach of the Member States' constitutional systems to
(1) Article II-72 of the Constitution.
(2) Article II-74 of the Constitution.
(3) Article II-107 of the Constitution.
(4) Article II-110 of the Constitution.
(5) Article II-111 of the Constitution.
466 Final act
954393_TRAITE_EN_451_481 13-01-2005 09:18 Pagina 466
‘principles’ particularly in the field of social law. For illustration, examples for principles recognised in the Charter
include e.g. Articles 25, 26 and 37 (1). In some cases, an Article of the Charter may contain both elements of a
right and of a principle, e.g. Articles 23, 33 and 34 (2).
Paragraph 6 refers to the various Articles in the Charter which, in the spirit of subsidiarity, make reference to
national laws and practices.
Article 53 (3)
Level of protection
Nothing in this Charter shall be interpreted as restricting or adversely affecting human rights and
fundamental freedoms as recognised, in their respective fields of application, by Union law and
international law and by international agreements to which the Union or all the Member States are
party, including the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms, and by the Member States' constitutions.
Explanation
This provision is intended to maintain the level of protection currently afforded within their respective scope by Union
law, national law and international law. Owing to its importance, mention is made of the ECHR.
Article 54 (4)
Prohibition of abuse of rights
Nothing in this Charter shall be interpreted as implying any right to engage in any activity or to
perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms recognised in this Charter
or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for herein.
Explanation
This Article corresponds to Article 17 of the ECHR:
‘Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any
activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their
limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.’

13. Declaration on Article III-116
The Conference agrees that, in its general efforts to eliminate inequalities between women and men,
the Union will aim in its different policies to combat all kinds of domestic violence. The
Member States should take all necessary measures to prevent and punish these criminal acts and to
support and protect the victims.
14. Declaration on Articles III-136 and III-267
The Conference considers that in the event that a draft European law or framework law based
on Article III-267(2) would affect fundamental aspects of the social security system of a
Member State, including its scope, cost or financial structure, or would affect the financial balance of
that system as set out in Article III-136(2), the interests of that Member State will be duly taken into
account.
15. Declaration on Articles III-160 and III-322
The Conference recalls that the respect for fundamental rights and freedoms implies, in particular,
that proper attention is given to the protection and observance of the due process rights of the
individuals or entities concerned. For this purpose and in order to guarantee a thorough judicial
review of European decisions subjecting an individual or entity to restrictive measures, such decisions
must be based on clear and distinct criteria. These criteria should be tailored to the specifics of each
restrictive measure.

The Conference notes that Article III-167(2)(c) shall be interpreted in accordance with the existing

regarding the applicability of the provisions to aid granted to certain areas of the Federal Republic of

With regard to Article III-184, the Conference confirms that raising growth potential and securing
sound budgetary positions are the two pillars of the economic and fiscal policy of the Union and the
Member States. The Stability and Growth Pact is an important tool to achieve these goals.
The Conference reaffirms its commitment to the provisions concerning the Stability and Growth Pact
as the framework for the coordination of budgetary policies in the Member States.
The Conference confirms that a rule-based system is the best guarantee for commitments to be
enforced and for all Member States to be treated equally.
468 Final act

Within this framework, the Conference also reaffirms its commitment to the goals of the
Lisbon Strategy: job creation, structural reforms, and social cohesion.
The Union aims at achieving balanced economic growth and price stability. Economic and budgetary
policies thus need to set the right priorities towards economic reforms, innovation, competitiveness
and strengthening of private investment and consumption in phases of weak economic growth. This
should be reflected in the orientations of budgetary decisions at the national and Union level in
particular through restructuring of public revenue and expenditure while respecting budgetary
discipline in accordance with the Constitution and the Stability and Growth Pact.
Budgetary and economic challenges facing the Member States underline the importance of sound
budgetary policy throughout the economic cycle.
The Conference agrees that Member States should use periods of economic recovery actively to
consolidate public finances and improve their budgetary positions. The objective is to gradually
achieve a budgetary surplus in good times which creates the necessary room to accommodate
economic downturns and thus contribute to the long-term sustainability of public finances.
The Member States look forward to possible proposals of the Commission as well as further
contributions of Member States with regard to strengthening and clarifying the implementation of
the Stability and Growth Pact. The Member States will take all necessary measures to raise the growth
potential of their economies. Improved economic policy coordination could support this objective.
This Declaration does not prejudge the future debate on the Stability and Growth Pact.
18. Declaration on Article III-213
The Conference confirms that the policies described in Article III-213 fall essentially within the
competence of the Member States. Measures to provide encouragement and promote coordination to
be taken at Union level in accordance with this Article shall be of a complementary nature. They shall
serve to strengthen cooperation between Member States and not to harmonise national systems. The
guarantees and practices existing in each Member State as regards the responsibility of the social
partners will not be affected.
This Declaration is without prejudice to the provisions of the Constitution conferring competence on
the Union, including in social matters.
19. Declaration on Article III-220
The Conference considers that the reference in Article III-220 to island regions can include
island States in their entirety, subject to the necessary criteria being met.

20. Declaration on Article III-243
The Conference notes that the provisions of Article III-243 shall be applied in accordance with the
current practice. The terms ‘such measures are required in order to compensate for the economic
disadvantages caused by the division of Germany to the economy of certain areas of the
Federal Republic affected by that division’ shall be interpreted in accordance with the existing caselaw
of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and of the Court of First Instance.
21. Declaration on Article III-248
The Conference agrees that the Union's action in the area of research and technological development
will pay due respect to the fundamental orientations and choices of the research policies of the
Member States.
22. Declaration on Article III-256
The Conference believes that Article III-256 does not affect the right of the Member States to take the
necessary measures to ensure their energy supply under the conditions provided for in Article III-131.
23. Declaration on Article III-273(1), second subparagraph
The Conference considers that the European laws referred to in the second subparagraph of
Article III-273(1) should take into account national rules and practices relating to the initiation of
criminal investigations.
24. Declaration on Article III-296
The Conference declares that, as soon as the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe is signed,
the Secretary-General of the Council, High Representative for the common foreign and security
policy, the Commission and the Member States should begin preparatory work on the European
External Action Service.
25. Declaration on Article III-325 concerning the negotiation and conclusion of
international agreements by Member States relating to the area of freedom, security and
justice
The Conference confirms that Member States may negotiate and conclude agreements with
third countries or international organisations in the areas covered by Sections 3, 4 and 5 of

agreements comply with Union law.

26. Declaration on Article III-402(4)
Article III-402(4) of the Constitution provides that where no European law of the Council
establishing a new financial framework has been adopted by the end of the previous financial
framework, the ceilings and other provisions corresponding to the last year of that framework shall
be extended until such time as that law is adopted.
The Conference states that if no European law of the Council establishing a new financial framework
has been adopted by the end of 2006 and where the Treaty of Accession of 16 April 2003 provides
for a phasing-in period for the allocation of appropriations to the new Member States ending
in 2006, the allocation of funds as from 2007 will be established on the basis of the same criteria
being applied for all Member States.
27. Declaration on Article III-419
The Conference declares that Member States may indicate, when they make a request to establish
enhanced cooperation, if they intend already at that stage to make use of Article III-422 providing for
the extension of qualified majority voting or to have recourse to the ordinary legislative procedure.
28. Declaration on Article IV-440(7)
The High Contracting Parties agree that the European Council, pursuant to Article IV-440(7), will
take a European decision leading to the modification of the status of Mayotte with regard to the
Union in order to make this territory an outermost region within the meaning of Article IV-440(2)
and Article III-424, when the French authorities notify the European Council and the Commission
that the evolution currently underway in the internal status of the island so allows.
29. Declaration on Article IV-448(2)
The Conference considers that the possibility of producing translations of the Treaty establishing a
Constitution for Europe in the languages mentioned in Article IV-448(2) contributes to fulfilling the
objective of respecting the Union's rich cultural and linguistic diversity as set forth in the
fourth subparagraph of Article I-3(3) of that Treaty. In this context, the Conference confirms the
attachment of the Union to the cultural diversity of Europe and the special attention it will continue
to pay to these and other languages.
The Conference recommends that those Member States wishing to avail themselves of the possibility
recognised in Article IV-448(2) communicate to the Council, within six months from the date of the
signature of that Treaty, the language or languages into which translations of that Treaty will be
made.

THE MEMBER STATES OF THE COMMUNITY
TAKE NOTE of the fact that the Italian Government is carrying out a ten-year programme of economic

ARE OF THE OPINION that the institutions of the Community should, in applying this Treaty, take
account of the sustained effort to be made by the Italian economy in the coming years and of the
desirability of avoiding dangerous stresses in particular within the balance of payments or the level of
employment, which might jeopardise the application of this Treaty in Italy;
RECOGNISE that in the event of Articles 109h and 109i being applied it will be necessary to take care

programme for economic expansion and for raising the standard of living of the population.’

1. Article 7 shall be replaced by the following:
Article 7
1. On a reasoned proposal by one third of the Member States, by the European Parliament or by
the Commission, the Council, acting by a majority of four-fifths of its members after obtaining the
assent of the European Parliament, may determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a
Member State of principles mentioned in Article 6(1), and address appropriate recommendations to
that State. Before making such a determination, the Council shall hear the Member State in question
and, acting in accordance with the same procedure, may call on independent persons to submit
within a reasonable time limit a report on the situation in the Member State in question.
The Council shall regularly verify that the grounds on which such a determination was made
continue to apply.
2. The Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government and acting by
unanimity on a proposal by one third of the Member States or by the Commission and after
obtaining the assent of the European Parliament, may determine the existence of a serious and
persistent breach by a Member State of principles mentioned in Article 6(1), after inviting the
government of the Member State in question to submit its observations.
3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 has been made, the Council, acting by a qualified
majority, may decide to suspend certain of the rights deriving from the application of this Treaty to
the Member State in question, including the voting rights of the representative of the government of
that Member State in the Council. In doing so, the Council shall take into account the possible
consequences of such a suspension on the rights and obligations of natural and legal persons.
The obligations of the Member State in question under this Treaty shall in any case continue to be
binding on that State.
4. The Council, acting by a qualified majority, may decide subsequently to vary or revoke
measures taken under paragraph 3 in response to changes in the situation which led to their
being imposed.
5. For the purposes of this Article, the Council shall act without taking into account the vote of
the representative of the government of the Member State in question. Abstentions by members
present in person or represented shall not prevent the adoption of decisions referred to in paragraph
2. A qualified majority shall be defined as the same proportion of the weighted votes of the
members of the Council concerned as laid down in Article 205(2) of the Treaty establishing the
European Community.
This paragraph shall also apply in the event of voting rights being suspended pursuant to paragraph
3.

majority of the votes cast, representing a majority of its Members.

Member States the adoption of such a decision in accordance with their respective constitutional
requirements.
The policy of the Union in accordance with this Article shall not prejudice the specific character of
the security and defence policy of certain Member States and shall respect the obligations of certain
Member States, which see their common defence realised in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO), under the North Atlantic Treaty and be compatible with the common security and defence
policy established within that framework.
The progressive framing of a common defence policy will be supported, as Member States consider
appropriate, by cooperation between them in the field of armaments.
2. Questions referred to in this Article shall include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping
tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking.
3. Decisions having defence implications dealt with under this Article shall be taken without
prejudice to the policies and obligations referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph.

(WEU) and NATO, provided such cooperation does not run counter to or impede that provided for
in this Title.

that it has to comply with the requirements of its own constitutional procedure; the other members
of the Council may agree that the agreement shall nevertheless apply provisionally.
6. Agreements concluded under the conditions set out by this Article shall be binding on the
institutions of the Union.

it by this Treaty by adopting internal rules.

agreement insofar as it also concerns the preceding subparagraph or the second subparagraph of

States.
The negotiation and conclusion of international agreements in the field of transport shall continue

proceedings and refers a case to the Court shall be notified to the Court by the court or tribunal
concerned. The decision shall then be notified by the Registrar of the Court to the parties, to the
Member States and to the Commission, and also to the Council or to the European Central Bank if the
act the validity or interpretation of which is in dispute originates from one of them, and to the
European Parliament and the Council if the act the validity or interpretation of which is in dispute
was adopted jointly by those two institutions.

appropriate, the European Parliament, the Council and the European Central Bank, shall be entitled to
submit statements of case or written observations to the Court.
In the cases governed by Article 234 of the EC Treaty, the decision of the national court or tribunal

Without prejudice to the second paragraph, the States, other than the Member States, which are parties
to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and also the EFTA Surveillance Authority referred to
in that Agreement, may intervene in cases before the Court where one of the fields of application that
Agreement is concerned.
An application to intervene shall be limited to supporting the form of order sought by one of the
parties.
Article 41
Where the defending party, after having been duly summoned, fails to file written submissions in
defence, judgment shall be given against that party by default. An objection may be lodged against
the judgment within one month of it being notified. The objection shall not have the effect of staying
enforcement of the judgment by default unless the Court decides otherwise.
Article 42
Member States, institutions of the Communities and any other natural or legal persons may, in cases and
under conditions to be determined by the Rules of Procedure, institute third-party proceedings to contest
a judgment rendered without their being heard, where the judgment is prejudicial to their rights.
Article 43
If the meaning or scope of a judgment is in doubt, the Court shall construe it on application by any
party or any institution of the Communities establishing an interest therein.
Article 44
An application for revision of a judgment may be made to the Court only on discovery of a fact which
is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor, and which, when the judgment was given, was unknown to
the Court and to the party claiming the revision.
The revision shall be opened by a judgment of the Court expressly recording the existence of a new fact,
recognising that it is of such a character as to lay the case open to revision and declaring the application
admissible on this ground.
No application for revision may be made after the lapse of 10 years from the date of the judgment.

the existence of unforeseeable circumstances or of force majeure.
Article 46
Proceedings against the Communities in matters arising from non-contractual liability shall be barred
after a period of five years from the occurrence of the event giving rise thereto. The period of limitation
shall be interrupted if proceedings are instituted before the Court or if prior to such proceedings an
application is made by the aggrieved party to the relevant institution of the Communities. In the latter
event the proceedings must be instituted within the period of two months provided for in Article 230 of
the EC Treaty and Article 146 of the EAEC Treaty; the provisions of the second paragraph of Article
232 of the EC Treaty and the second paragraph of Article 148 of the EAEC Treaty, respectively, shall
apply where appropriate.

THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
Article 47
Articles 2 to 8, Articles 14 and 15, the first, second, fourth and fifth paragraphs of Article 17 and Article
18 shall apply to the Court of First Instance and its members. The oath referred to in Article 2 shall be
taken before the Court of Justice and the decisions referred to in Articles 3, 4 and 6 shall be adopted by
that Court after hearing the Court of First Instance.
The fourth paragraph of Article 3 and Articles 10, 11 and 14 shall apply to the Registrar of the Court of
First Instance mutatis mutandis.
Article 48
The Court of First Instance shall consist of 15 Judges.
Article 49
The members of the Court of First Instance may be called upon to perform the task of an Advocate-
General.
It shall be the duty of the Advocate-General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to
make, in open court, reasoned submissions on certain cases brought before the Court of First Instance in
order to assist the Court of First Instance in the performance of its task.
The criteria for selecting such cases, as well as the procedures for designating the Advocates-General,
shall be laid down in the Rules of Procedure of the Court of First Instance.
A member called upon to perform the task of Advocate-General in a case may not take part in the
judgment of the case.
C 80/62 EN Official Journal of the European Communities 10.3.2001
Article 50
The Court of First Instance shall sit in chambers of three or five Judges. The Judges shall elect the
Presidents of the chambers from among their number. The Presidents of the chambers of five Judges
shall be elected for three years. They may be re-elected once.
The composition of the chambers and the assignment of cases to them shall be governed by the Rules of
Procedure. In certain cases governed by the Rules of Procedure, the Court of First Instance may sit as a
full court or be constituted by a single Judge.
The Rules of Procedure may also provide that the Court of First Instance may sit in a Grand Chamber in
cases and under the conditions specified therein.
Article 51
By way of exception to the rule laid down in Article 225(1) of the EC Treaty and Article 140a(1) of the
EAEC Treaty, the Court of Justice shall have jurisdiction in actions brought by the Member States, by the
institutions of the Communities and by the European Central Bank.
Article 52
The President of the Court of Justice and the President of the Court of First Instance shall determine, by
common accord, the conditions under which officials and other servants attached to the Court of Justice
shall render their services to the Court of First Instance to enable it to function. Certain officials or other
servants shall be responsible to the Registrar of the Court of First Instance under the authority of the
President of the Court of First Instance.
Article 53
The procedure before the Court of First Instance shall be governed by Title III.
Such further and more detailed provisions as may be necessary shall be laid down in its Rules of
Procedure. The Rules of Procedure may derogate from the fourth paragraph of Article 40 and from
Article 41 in order to take account of the specific features of litigation in the field of intellectual
property.
Notwithstanding the fourth paragraph of Article 20, the Advocate-General may make his reasoned
submissions in writing.
Article 54
Where an application or other procedural document addressed to the Court of First Instance is lodged
by mistake with the Registrar of the Court of Justice, it shall be transmitted immediately by that
Registrar to the Registrar of the Court of First Instance; likewise, where an application or other
procedural document addressed to the Court of Justice is lodged by mistake with the Registrar of the
Court of First Instance, it shall be transmitted immediately by that Registrar to the Registrar of the Court
of Justice.
Where the Court of First Instance finds that it does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine an
action in respect of which the Court of Justice has jurisdiction, it shall refer that action to the Court of
Justice; likewise, where the Court of Justice finds that an action falls within the jurisdiction of the Court
of First Instance, it shall refer that action to the Court of First Instance, whereupon that Court may not
decline jurisdiction.
10.3.2001 EN Official Journal of the European Communities C 80/63
Where the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance are seised of cases in which the same relief is
sought, the same issue of interpretation is raised or the validity of the same act is called in question, the
Court of First Instance may, after hearing the parties, stay the proceedings before it until such time as
the Court of Justice shall have delivered judgment. Where applications are made for the same act to be
declared void, the Court of First Instance may also decline jurisdiction in order that the Court of Justice
may rule on such applications. In the cases referred to in this paragraph, the Court of Justice may also
decide to stay the proceedings before it; in that event, the proceedings before the Court of First Instance
shall continue.
Article 55
Final decisions of the Court of First Instance, decisions disposing of the substantive issues in part only or
disposing of a procedural issue concerning a plea of lack of competence or inadmissibility, shall be
notified by the Registrar of the Court of First Instance to all parties as well as all Member States and the
institutions of the Communities even if they did not intervene in the case before the Court of First
Instance.
Article 56
An appeal may be brought before the Court of Justice, within two months of the notification of the
decision appealed against, against final decisions of the Court of First Instance and decisions of that
Court disposing of the substantive issues in part only or disposing of a procedural issue concerning a
plea of lack of competence or inadmissibility.
Such an appeal may be brought by any party which has been unsuccessful, in whole or in part, in its
submissions. However, interveners other than the Member States and the institutions of the
Communities may bring such an appeal only where the decision of the Court of First Instance
directly affects them.
With the exception of cases relating to disputes between the Communities and their servants, an appeal
may also be brought by Member States and institutions of the Communities which did not intervene in
the proceedings before the Court of First Instance. Such Member States and institutions shall be in the
same position as Member States or institutions which intervened at first instance.
Article 57
Any person whose application to intervene has been dismissed by the Court of First Instance may appeal
to the Court of Justice within two weeks from the notification of the decision dismissing the application.
The parties to the proceedings may appeal to the Court of Justice against any decision of the Court of
First Instance made pursuant to Article 242 or Article 243 or the fourth paragraph of Article 256 of the
EC Treaty or Article 157 or Article 158 or the third paragraph of Article 164 of the EAEC Treaty within
two months from their notification.
The appeal referred to in the first two paragraphs of this Article shall be heard and determined under
the procedure referred to in Article 39.
C 80/64 EN Official Journal of the European Communities 10.3.2001
Article 58
An appeal to the Court of Justice shall be limited to points of law. It shall lie on the grounds of lack of
competence of the Court of First Instance, a breach of procedure before it which adversely affects the
interests of the appellant as well as the infringement of Community law by the Court of First Instance.
No appeal shall lie regarding only the amount of the costs or the party ordered to pay them.
Article 59
Where an appeal is brought against a decision of the Court of First Instance, the procedure before the
Court of Justice shall consist of a written part and an oral part. In accordance with conditions laid down
in the Rules of Procedure, the Court of Justice, having heard the Advocate-General and the parties, may
dispense with the oral procedure.
Article 60
Without prejudice to Articles 242 and 243 of the EC Treaty or Articles 157 and 158 of the EAEC Treaty,
an appeal shall not have suspensory effect.
By way of derogation from Article 244 of the EC Treaty and Article 159 of the EAEC Treaty, decisions
of the Court of First Instance declaring a regulation to be void shall take effect only as from the date of
expiry of the period referred to in the first paragraph of Article 56 of this Statute or, if an appeal shall
have been brought within that period, as from the date of dismissal of the appeal, without prejudice,
however, to the right of a party to apply to the Court of Justice, pursuant to Articles 242 and 243 of the
EC Treaty or Articles 157 and 158 of the EAEC Treaty, for the suspension of the effects of the regulation
which has been declared void or for the prescription of any other interim measure.
Article 61
If the appeal is well founded, the Court of Justice shall quash the decision of the Court of First Instance.
It may itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits, or refer the
case back to the Court of First Instance for judgment.
Where a case is referred back to the Court of First Instance, that Court shall be bound by the decision of
the Court of Justice on points of law.
When an appeal brought by a Member State or an institution of the Communities, which did not
intervene in the proceedings before the Court of First Instance, is well founded, the Court of Justice may,
if it considers this necessary, state which of the effects of the decision of the Court of First Instance
which has been quashed shall be considered as definitive in respect of the parties to the litigation.
Article 62
In the cases provided for in Article 225(2) and (3) of the EC Treaty and Article 140a(2) and (3) of the
EAEC Treaty, where the First Advocate-General considers that there is a serious risk of the unity or
consistency of Community law being affected, he may propose that the Court of Justice review the
decision of the Court of First Instance.
The proposal must be made within one month of delivery of the decision by the Court of First Instance.
Within one month of receiving the proposal made by the First Advocate-General, the Court of Justice
shall decide whether or not the decision should be reviewed.

DECLARATIONS ADOPTED BY THE CONFERENCE
1. Declaration on the European security and defence policy
In accordance with the texts approved by the European Council in Nice concerning the European
security and defence policy (Presidency report and Annexes), the objective for the European Union is
for that policy to become operational quickly. A decision to that end will be taken by the European
Council as soon as possible in 2001 and no later than at its meeting in Laeken/Brussels, on the basis of
the existing provisions of the Treaty on European Union. Consequently, the entry into force of the
Treaty of Nice does not constitute a precondition.
2. Declaration on Article 31(2) of the Treaty on European Union
The Conference recalls that:
 the decision to set up a unit composed of national prosecutors, magistrates or police officers of
equivalent competence, detached from each Member State (Eurojust), having the task of facilitating
proper coordination between national prosecuting authorities and of supporting criminal investigations
in organised crime cases, was provided for in the Presidency conclusions of the European
Council at Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999;
 the European Judicial Network was set up by Joint Action 98/428/JHA adopted by the Council on
29 June 1998 (OJ L 191, 7.7.1998, p. 4).
3. Declaration on Article 10 of the Treaty establishing the European Community
The Conference recalls that the duty of sincere cooperation which derives from Article 10 of the Treaty
establishing the European Community and governs relations between the Member States and the
Community institutions also governs relations between the Community institutions themselves. In
relations between those institutions, when it proves necessary, in the context of that duty of sincere
cooperation, to facilitate the application of the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European
Community, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission may conclude interinstitutional
agreements. Such agreements may not amend or supplement the provisions of the Treaty and may be
concluded only with the agreement of these three institutions.
4. Declaration on the third paragraph of Article 21 of the Treaty establishing the European
Community
The Conference calls upon the institutions and bodies referred to in the third paragraph of Article 21 or
in Article 7 to ensure that the reply to any written request by a citizen of the Union is made within a
reasonable period.
5. Declaration on Article 67 of the Treaty establishing the European Community
The High Contracting Parties agree that the Council, in the decision it is required to take pursuant to the
second indent of Article 67(2):
10.3.2001 EN Official Journal of the European Communities C 80/77
 will decide, from 1 May 2004, to act in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 in
order to adopt the measures referred to in Article 62(3) and Article 63(3)(b);
 will decide to act in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 in order to adopt the
measures referred to in Article 62(2)(a) from the date on which agreement is reached on the scope
of the measures concerning the crossing by persons of the external borders of the Member States.
The Council will, moreover, endeavour to make the procedure referred to in Article 251 applicable from
1 May 2004 or as soon as possible thereafter to the other areas covered by Title IV or to parts of them.
6. Declaration on Article 100 of the Treaty establishing the European Community
The Conference recalls that decisions regarding financial assistance, such as are provided for in Article
100 and are compatible with the no bail-out rule laid down in Article 103, must comply with the
2000-2006 financial perspective, and in particular paragraph 11 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6
May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline
and improvement of the budgetary procedure, and with the corresponding provisions of future interinstitutional
agreements and financial perspectives.
7. Declaration on Article 111 of the Treaty establishing the European Community
The Conference agrees that procedures shall be such as to enable all the Member States in the euro area
to be fully involved in each stage of preparing the position of the Community at international level as
regards issues of particular relevance to economic and monetary union.
8. Declaration on Article 137 of the Treaty establishing the European Community
The Conference agrees that any expenditure incurred by virtue of Article 137 is to be charged to heading
3 of the financial perspective.
9. Declaration on Article 175 of the Treaty establishing the European Community
The High Contracting Parties are determined to see the European Union play a leading role in
promoting environmental protection in the Union and in international efforts pursuing the same
objective at global level. Full use should be made of all possibilities offered by the Treaty with a view
to pursuing this objective, including the use of incentives and instruments which are market-oriented
and intended to promote sustainable development.
10. Declaration on Article 181a of the Treaty establishing the European Community
The Conference confirms that, without prejudice to other provisions of the Treaty establishing the
European Community, balance-of-payments aid to third countries falls outside the scope of Article 181a.
C 80/78 EN Official Journal of the European Communities 10.3.2001
11. Declaration on Article 191 of the Treaty establishing the European Community
The Conference recalls that the provisions of Article 191 do not imply any transfer of powers to the
European Community and do not affect the application of the relevant national constitutional rules.
The funding for political parties at European level provided out of the budget of the European
Communities may not be used to fund, either directly or indirectly, political parties at national level.
The provisions on the funding for political parties shall apply, on the same basis, to all the political
forces represented in the European Parliament.
12. Declaration on Article 225 of the Treaty establishing the European Community
The Conference calls on the Court of Justice and the Commission to give overall consideration as soon
as possible to the division of jurisdiction between the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance, in
particular in the area of direct actions, and to submit suitable proposals for examination by the
competent bodies as soon as the Treaty of Nice enters into force.
13. Declaration on Article 225(2) and (3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community
The Conference considers that the essential provisions of the review procedure in Article 225(2) and (3)
should be defined in the Statute of the Court of Justice. Those provisions should in particular specify:
 the role of the parties in proceedings before the Court of Justice, in order to safeguard their rights;
 the effect of the review procedure on the enforceability of the decision of the Court of First Instance;
 the effect of the Court of Justice decision on the dispute between the parties.
14. Declaration on Article 225(2) and (3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community
The Conference considers that when the Council adopts the provisions of the Statute which are
necessary to implement Article 225(2) and (3), it should put a procedure in place to ensure that the
practical operation of those provisions is evaluated no later than three years after the entry into force of
the Treaty of Nice.
10.3.2001 EN Official Journal of the European Communities C 80/79
15. Declaration on Article 225(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community
The Conference considers that, in exceptional cases in which the Court of Justice decides to review a
decision of the Court of First Instance on a question referred for a preliminary ruling, it should act under
an emergency procedure.
16. Declaration on Article 225a of the Treaty establishing the European Community
The Conference asks the Court of Justice and the Commission to prepare as swiftly as possible a draft
decision establishing a judicial panel which has jurisdiction to deliver judgments at first instance on
disputes between the Community and its servants.
17. Declaration on Article 229a of the Treaty establishing the European Community
The Conference considers that Article 229a does not prejudge the choice of the judicial framework
which may be set up to deal with disputes relating to the application of acts adopted on the basis of the
Treaty establishing the European Community which create Community industrial property rights.
18. Declaration on the Court of Auditors
The Conference invites the Court of Auditors and the national audit institutions to improve the
framework and conditions for cooperation between them, while maintaining the autonomy of each.
To that end, the President of the Court of Auditors may set up a contact committee with the chairmen
of the national audit institutions.
19. Declaration on Article 10.6 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the
European Central Bank
The Conference expects that a recommendation within the meaning of Article 10.6 of the Statute of the
European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank will be presented as soon as
possible.
20. Declaration on the enlargement of the European Union (1)
The common position to be adopted by the Member States at the accession conferences, as regards the
distribution of seats at the European Parliament, the weighting of votes in the Council, the composition
of the Economic and Social Committee and the composition of the Committee of the Regions will
correspond to the following tables for a Union of 27 Member States.
___________
(1) The tables in this declaration take account only of those candidate countries with which accession negotiations have
actually started.

21. Declaration on the qualified majority threshold and the number of votes for a blocking minority
in an enlarged Union
Insofar as all the candidate countries listed in the Declaration on the enlargement of the European Union
have not yet acceded to the Union when the new vote weightings take effect (1 January 2005), the
threshold for a qualified majority will move, according to the pace of accessions, from a percentage
below the current one to a maximum of 73,4 %. When all the candidate countries mentioned above
have acceded, the blocking minority, in a Union of 27, will be raised to 91 votes, and the qualified
majority threshold resulting from the table given in the Declaration on enlargement of the European
Union will be automatically adjusted accordingly.
22. Declaration on the venue for European Councils
As from 2002, one European Council meeting per Presidency will be held in Brussels. When the Union
comprises 18 members, all European Council meetings will be held in Brussels.
23. Declaration on the future of the Union
1. Important reforms have been decided in Nice. The Conference welcomes the successful conclusion of
the Conference of Representatives of the Governments of the Member States and commits the
Member States to pursue the early ratification of the Treaty of Nice.
2. It agrees that the conclusion of the Conference of Representatives of the Governments of the Member
States opens the way for enlargement of the European Union and underlines that, with ratification of
the Treaty of Nice, the European Union will have completed the institutional changes necessary for
the accession of new Member States.
3. Having thus opened the way to enlargement, the Conference calls for a deeper and wider debate
about the future of the European Union. In 2001, the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies, in cooperation
with the Commission and involving the European Parliament, will encourage wide-ranging
discussions with all interested parties: representatives of national parliaments and all those reflecting
public opinion, namely political, economic and university circles, representatives of civil society, etc.
The candidate States will be associated with this process in ways to be defined.
4. Following a report to be drawn up for the European Council in Göteborg in June 2001, the European
Council, at its meeting in Laeken/Brussels in December 2001, will agree on a declaration containing
appropriate initiatives for the continuation of this process.
5. The process should address, inter alia, the following questions:
 how to establish and monitor a more precise delimitation of powers between the European Union
and the Member States, reflecting the principle of subsidiarity;
 the status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, proclaimed in Nice, in
accordance with the conclusions of the European Council in Cologne;
10.3.2001 EN Official Journal of the European Communities C 80/85
 a simplification of the Treaties with a view to making them clearer and better understood without
changing their meaning;
 the role of national parliaments in the European architecture.
6. Addressing the abovementioned issues, the Conference recognises the need to improve and to
monitor the democratic legitimacy and transparency of the Union and its institutions, in order to
bring them closer to the citizens of the Member States.
7. After these preparatory steps, the Conference agrees that a new Conference of the Representatives of
the Governments of the Member States will be convened in 2004, to address the abovementioned
items with a view to making corresponding changes to the Treaties.
8. The Conference of Member States shall not constitute any form of obstacle or pre-condition to the
enlargement process. Moreover, those candidate States which have concluded accession negotiations
with the Union will be invited to participate in the Conference. Those candidate States which have
not concluded their accession negotiations will be invited as observers.
24. Declaration on Article 2 of the Protocol on the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC
Treaty and on the research fund for coal and steel
The Conference invites the Council to ensure, under Article 2 of the Protocol, the prolongation of the
ECSC statistics system after the expiry of the ECSC Treaty until 31 December 2002 and to invite the
Commission to make the appropriate recommendations.
C 80/86 EN Official Journal of the European Communities 10.3.2001
DECLARATIONS OF WHICH THE CONFERENCE TOOK NOTE
1. Declaration by Luxembourg
Without prejudice to the Decision of 8 April 1965 and the provisions and possibilities contained therein
regarding the seats of institutions, bodies and departments to be set up, the Luxembourg Government
undertakes not to claim the seat of the Boards of Appeal of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal
Market (trade marks and designs), which will remain in Alicante, even if those Boards were to become
judicial panels within the meaning of Article 220 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
2. Declaration by Greece, Spain and Portugal on Article 161 of the Treaty establishing the European
Community
Greece, Spain and Portugal have agreed to the move to a qualified majority in Article 161 of the Treaty
establishing the European Community on the basis that the word multiannual in the third paragraph
means that the financial perspective applicable from 1 January 2007 and the Interinstitutional
Agreement relating thereto will have the same duration as the current financial perspective.
3. Declaration by Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria on Article 161 of the Treaty
establishing the European Community
With regard to the Declaration by Greece, Spain and Portugal on Article 161 of the Treaty establishing
the European Community, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria declare that that Declaration
is without prejudice to actions of the European Commission, in particular with respect to its right of
initiative.

their respective constitutional requirements.

Treaty of Amsterdam 103
C. PROTOCOLS ANNEXED TO THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITY
Protocol on asylum for nationals of Member States of the European Union
THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,
WHEREAS pursuant to the provisions of Article F(2) of the Treaty on European Union the
Union shall respect fundamental rights as guaranteed by the European Convention for the
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms signed in Rome on 4 November
1950;
WHEREAS the Court of Justice of the European Communities has jurisdiction to ensure that
in the interpretation and application of Article F(2) of the Treaty on European Union the law
is observed by the European Community;
WHEREAS pursuant to Article O of the Treaty on European Union any European Sute, when
applying to become a Member of the Union, must respect the principles set out in Article F(l)
of the Treaty on European Union;
BEARING IN MIND that Article 236 of the Treaty esublishing the European Community
establishes a mechanism for the suspension of certain rights in the event of a serious and
persistent breach by-a Member Sute of those principles;
RECALLING that each national of a Member State, as a citizen of the Union, enjoys a special
status and protection which shall be guaranteed by the Member States in accordance with the

BEARING IN MIND that the Treaty esublishing the European Community establishes an area
without internal frontiers and grants every citizen of the Union the right to move and reside
freely within the territory of the Member Sutes;
RECALLING that the question of extradition of nationals of Member Sutes of the Union is
addressed in the European Convention on Extradition of 13 December 1957 and the

European Union relating to extradition between the Member States of the European Union;
WISHING to prevent the institution of asylum being resorted to for purposes alien to those for

104 Protocols
HAVE AGREED UPON the following provisions which shall be annexed to the Treaty esublishing

Sole Article
Given the level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms by the Member Sutes of the
European Union, Member Sutes shall be regarded as constituting safe countries of origin in
respect of each other for all legal and practical purposes in relation to asylum matters.
Accordingly, any application for asylum made by a national of a Member Sute may be taken
into consideration or declared admissible for processing by another Member Sute only in the
following cases:
(a) if the Member Sute of which the applicant is a national proceeds after the entry into
force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, availing itself of the provisions of Article 15 of the
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamenul Freedoms, to take
measures derogating in its territory from its obligations under that Convention;
(b) if the procedure referred to in Article F.l(l) of the Treaty on European Union has been
initiated and until the Council takes a decision in respect thereof;
(c) if the Council, acting on the basis of Article F.l(l) of the Treaty on European Union, has
determined, in respect of the Member Sute which the applicant is a national, the existence
of a serious and persistent breach by that Member Sute of principles mentioned in
Article F(l);
(d) if a Member State should so decide unilaterally in respect of the application of a national
of another Member State; in that case the Council shall be immediately informed; the

power of the Member State.
Treaty of Amsterdam 105
Protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality
THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,
DETERMINED to esublish the conditions for the application of the principles of subsidiarity
and proportionality enshrined in Article 3b of the Treaty esubhshing the European
Community with a view to defining more precisely the criteria for applying them and to
ensure their strict observance and consistent implemenution by all institutions;
WISHING to ensure that decisions are uken as closely as possible to the citizens of the Union;
TAKING ACCOUNT of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 25 October 1993 between the
European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on procedures for implementing the
principle of subsidiarity;
HAVE CONHRMED that the conclusions of the Birmingham European Council on
16 October 1992 and the overall approach to the application of the subsidiarity principle
agreed by the European Council meeting in Edinburgh on 11-12 December 1992 will continue
to guide the action of the Union's institutions as well as the development of the application of
the principle of subsidiarity, and, for this purpose,
HAVE AGREED UPON the following provisions which shall be annexed to the Treaty establishing
the European Community:
(1) In exercising the powers conferred on it, each institution shall ensure that the principle of
subsidiarity is complied with. It shall also ensure compliance with the principle of proportionality,
according to which any action by the Community shall not go beyond what is
necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaty.
(2) The application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality shall respect the
general provisions and the objectives of the Treaty, particularly as regards the mainuining
in full of the acquis communautaire and the institutional balance; it shall not affect
the principles developed by the Court of Justice regarding the relationship between
national and Community law, and it should uke into account Article F(4) of the Treaty
on European Union, according to which 'the Union shall provide itself with the means
necessary to attain its objectives and carry through its policies'.
(3) The principle of subsidiarity does not call into question the powers conferred on the
European Community by the Treaty, as interpreted by the Court of Justice. The criteria
referred to in the second paragraph of Article 3b of the Treaty shall relate to areas for
which the Community does not have exclusive competence. The principle of subsidiarity
provides a guide as to how those powers are to be exercised at the Community level.
Subsidiarity is a dynamic concept and should be applied in the light of the objectives set
106 Protocols
out in the Treaty. It allows Community action within the limits of its powers to be
expanded where circumsunces so require, and conversely, to be restricted or discontinued
where it is no longer justified.
(4) For any proposed Community legislation, the reasons on which it is based shall be suted
with a view to justifying its compliance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality;
the reasons for concluding that a Cornmunity objective can be better achieved
by the Community must be subsuntiated by qualiutive or, wherever possible, quantiutive
indicators.
(5) For Community action to be justified, both aspects of the subsidiarity principle shall be
met: the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiendy achieved by Member
Sutes' action in the framework of their national constitutional system and can therefore
be better achieved by action on the part of the Community.
The following guidelines should be used in examining whether the abovementioned
condition is fulfilled:
the issue under consideration has transnational aspects which cannot be satisfactorily
regulated by action by Member States;
actions by Member States alone or lack of Community action would conflict with the
requirements of the Treaty (such as the need to correa distortion of competition or
avoid disguised restrictions on trade or strengthen economic and social cohesion) or
would otherwise significantly damage Member Sutes' interests;
action at Community level would produce clear benefits by reason of its scale or
effects compared with action at the level of the Member Sutes.
(6) The form of Community action shall be as simple as possible, consistent with satisfactory
achievement of the objective of the measure and the need for effective enforcement. The
Community shall legislate only to the^extent necessary. Other things being equal,
directives should be preferred to regulations and framework directives to detailed
measures. Directives as provided for in Article 189 of the Treaty, while binding upon
each Member Sute to which they are addressed as to the result to be achieved, shall
leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods.
(7) Regarding the nature and the extent of Community action, Community measures should
leave as much scope for national decision as possible, consistent with securing the aim of
the measure and observing the requirements of the Treaty. While respecting Community
law, care should be uken to respect well established national arrangements and the
organisation and working of Member Sutes' legal systems. Where appropriate and
subject to the need for proper enforcement, Community measures should provide
Member Sutes with alternative ways to achieve the objectives of the measures.
Treaty of Amsterdam 107
(8) Where the application of the principle of subsidiarity leads to no action being uken by
the Community, Member Sutes are required in their action to comply with the general
rules laid down in Article 5 of the Treaty, by uking all appropriate measures to ensure
fulfilment of their obligations under the Treaty and by abstaining from any measure
which could jeopardise the attainment of the objectives of the Treaty.
(9) Without prejudice to its right of initiative, the Commission should:
— except in cases of particular urgency or confidentiality, consult widely before
proposing legislation and, wherever appropriate, publish consulution documents;
— justify the relevance of its proposals with regard to the principle of subsidiarity;
whenever necessary, the explanatory memorandum accompanying a proposal will
give deuils in this respect. The financing of Community action in whole or in part
from the Community budget shall require an explanation;
— take duly into account the need for any burden, whether financial or administrative,
falling upon the Community, national governments, local authorities, economic
operators and citizens, to be minimised and proportionate to the objective to be
achieved;
— submit an annual report to the European Council, the European Parliament and the
Council on the application of Article 3b of the Treaty. This annual report shall also
be sent to the Committee of the Regions and to the Economic and Social Committee.
(10) The European Council shall take account of the Commission report referred to in the
fourth indent of point 9 within the report on the progress achieved by the Union which it
is required to submit to the European Parliament in accordance with Article D of the
Treaty on European Union.
(11) While fully observing the procedures applicable, the European Parliament and the
Council shall, as an integral part of the overall examination of Commission proposals,
consider their consistency with Article 3b of the Treaty. This concerns the original
Commission proposal as well as amendments which the European Parliament and the
Council envisage making to the proposal.
(12) In the course of the procedures referred to in Articles 189b and 189c of the Treaty, the
European Parliament shall be informed of the Council's position on the application of
Article 3b of the Treaty, by way of a statement of the reasons which led the Council to
adopt its common position. The Council shall inform the European Parliament of the
reasons on the basis of which all or part of a Commission proposal is deemed to be
inconsistent with Article 3b of the Treaty.
(13) Compliance with the principle of subsidiarity shall be reviewed in accordance with the
rules laid down by the Treaty.

Protocol on the system of public broadcasting in the Member States

pluralism,
HAVE AGREED UPON the following interpreutive provisions, which shall be annexed to the
Treaty establishing the European Community,
The provisions of the Treaty esublishing the European Community shall be without prejudice
to the competence of Member Sutes to provide for the funding of public service broadcasting
insofar as such funding is granted to broadcasting organisations for the fulfilment of the
public service remit as conferred, defined and organised by each Member State, and insofar as
such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Community to an
extent which would be contrary to the common interest, while the realisation of the remit of
that public service shall be uken into account.

The Conference notes the following Declaration, adopted by the Council of Ministers of the
Western European Union on 22 July 1997
'DECLARATION OF WESTERN EUROPEAN UNION ON THE ROLE OF WESTERN
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WITH
THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE
INTRODUCTION
1. The Western European Union (WEU) Member Sutes agreed at Maastricht in 1991 on the
need to develop a genuine European Security and Defence Identity (ESDI) and to assume
a greater European responsibility for defence matters. In the light of the Treaty of
Amsterdam, they reaffirm the importance of continuing and strengthening these efforts.
WEU is an integral part of the development of the European Union (EU) providing the
Union with access to an operational capability, noubly in the context of the Petersberg
tasks and is an essential element of the development of the ESDI within the Atlantic
Alliance in accordance with the Paris Declaration and with the decisions uken by NATO
ministers in Berlin.
2. Today the WEU Council brings together all the Member States of the European Umon
and all the European Members of the Atlantic Alliance in accordance with their respective
status. The Council also brings together those States with the Central and Eastern
126 Final Act
European States linked to the European Union by an Association Agreement and that are
applicants for accession to both the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance. WEU is
thus establishing itself as a genuine framework for dialogue and cooperation among
Europeans on wider European security and defence issues.
3. In this context, WEU takes note of Title V of the Treaty on European Union regarding
the EU's common foreign and security policy, in particular Articles J.3(l), J.7 and the
Protocol to Article J.7, which read as follows:
Article J.3(l)
"1. The European Council shall define the principles and general guidelines for the common
foreign and security policy, including for matters with defence implications. "
Article J.7
"1. The common foreign and security policy shall include all questions relating to the
security of the Union, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy, in
accordance with the second subparagraph, which might lead to a common defence, should the
European Council so decide. It shall in that case recommend to the Member States the
adoption of such a decision in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.
The Western European Union (WEU) is an integral part of the development of the Union
providing the Union with access to an operational capability notably in the context of
paragraph 2. It supports the Union in framing 'the defence aspects of the common foreign and
security policy as set out in this Article. The Union shall accordingly foster closer institutional
rektions with the WEU with a view to the possibility of the integration of the WEU into the
Union, should the European Council so decide. It shall in that case recommend to the Member
States the adoption of such a decision in accordance with their respective constitutional
requirements.
The policy of the Union in accordance with this Article shall not prejudice the specific
character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States and shall respect the
obligations of certain Member States, which see their common defence realised in the North
Adantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), under the North Atlantic Treaty and be compatible
with the common security and defence policy established within that framework.
The progressive framing of a common defence policy will be supported, as Member States
consider appropriate, by cooperation between them in the field of armaments.
2. Questions referred to in this Article shall include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping
tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace making.
3. The Union will avail itself of the WEU to elaborate and implement decisions and
actions of the Union which have defence implications.
Treaty of Amsterdam 127
The competence of the European Council to establish guidelines in accordance with Article J.3
shall aho obtain in respect of the WEU for those matters for which the Union avails itself of
the WEU.
When the Union avails itself of the WEU to elaborate and implement decisions of the Union
on the tasks referred to in paragraph 2, all Member States of the Union shall be entitled to
participate fully in the tasks in question. The Council, in agreement with the institutions of
the WEU, shall adopt the necessary practical arrangements to allow all Member States
contributing to the tasks in question to participate fully and on an equal footing in planning
and decision-taking in the WEU
Decisions having defence implications dealt with under this paragraph shall be taken without
prejudice to the policies and obligations referred to in paragraph 1, third subparagraph.
4. The provisions of this Article shall not prevent the development of closer cooperation
between two or more Member States on a bilateral level, in the framework of the WEU and
the Adantic Alliance, provided such cooperation does not run counter to or impede that
provided for in this Title.
5. With a view to furthering the objectives of this Article, the provisions of this Article will
be reviewed in accordance with Article N. "
Protocol on Article J.7
"THE HIGH CONTRA^NG ΡΑίΙΉΕΞ,
BEARING IN MIND the need to implement fully the provisions of Article J. 7(1), second
subparagraph, and (3) of the Treaty on European Union,
BEARING IN MIND that the policy of the Union in accordance with Article J.7 shall not
prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States and
shall respect the obligations of certain Member States, which see their common defence realised
in NATO, under the North Adantic Treaty and be compatible with the common security and
defence policy established within that framework,
HAVE AGREED UPON the following provision, which is annexed to the Treaty on European
Union,

arrangements for enhanced cooperation between them, within a year from the entry into force
of the Treaty of Amsterdam"
128 Final Act
A. WElPs RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION: ACCOMPANYING THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TREATY OF AMSTERDAM
4. In the "Declaration on the Role of the Western European Union and its Relations with
the European Union and with the Atlantic Alliance" of 10 December 1991, WEU
Member Sutes set as their objective "to build up WEU in suges as the defence
component of the European Union". They today reaffirm this aim as developed by the
Treaty of Amsterdam.
5. When the Union avails itself of WEU, WEU will elaborate and implement decisions and
actions of the EU which have defence implications.
In elaborating and implementing decisions and actions of the EU for which the Union
avails itself of WEU, WEU will aa consistently with guidelines established by the
European Council.
WEU supports the Union in framing the defence aspects of the European Union Common
Foreign and Security Policy as set out in Article J.7 of the Treaty on European Union.
6. WEU confirms that when the European Union avails itself of WEU to elaborate and
implement decisions of the Union on the tasks referred to in Article J.7(2) of the Treaty
on European Union, all Member States of the Union shall be entided to participate fully
in the tasks in question in accordance with Article J.7(3) of the Treaty on European
Union.
WEU will develop the role of the Observers in WEU in line with provisions contained in
Article J.7(3) and will adopt the necessary practical arrangements to allow all Member
Sutes of the EU contributing to the tasks undertaken by WEU at the request of the EU
to participate fully and on an equal footing in planning and decision-uking in the WEU.
7. Consistent with the Protocol on Article J.7 of the Treaty on European Union, WEU shall
draw up, together with the European Union, arrangements for enhanced cooperation
between them. In this regard, a range of measures, on some of which work is already at
hand in WEU, can be taken forward now, such as:
y
— arrangements for improving the coordination of the consulution and decision-making
processes of the respective Organisations, in particular in crisis situations;
— holding of joint meetings of the relevant bodies of the two Organisations;
— harmonisation as much as possible of the sequence of the Presidencies of WEU and
the EU, as well as the administrative rules and practices of the two Organisations;
— close coordination of the work of the staff of the Secretariat-General of the WEU and
the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU, including through the exchange and
secondment of personnel;
Treaty of Amsterdam 129
— arrangements to allow the relevant bodies of the EU, including its Policy Planning and
Early Warning Unit, to draw on the resources of WEU's Planning Cell, Situation
Centre and Satellite Centre;
— cooperation in the field of armaments, as appropriate, within the framework of the
Western European Armaments Group (WEAG), as the European forum for
armaments cooperation, the EU and WEU in the context of rationalisation of the
European armaments market and the establishment of a European Armaments Agency;
— practical arrangements for ensuring cooperation with the European Commission
reflecting its role in the CFSP as defined in the revised Treaty on European Union;
— improved security arrangements with the European Union.
B. RELATIONS BETWEEN WEU AND NATO IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE DEVELOPMENT
OF AN ESDI WITHIN THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE
8. The Adantic Alliance continues to be the basis of collective defence under the North
Atlantic Treaty. It remains the essential forum for consulution among Allies and the
framework in which they agree on policies bearing on their security and defence
commitments under the Washington Treaty. The Alliance has embarked on a process of
adapution and reform so that it can more effectively carry out the full range of its
missions. This process is aimed at strengthening and renewing the transadantic partnership,
including building an ESDI within the Alliance.
9. WEU is an essential element of the development of the European Security and Defence
Identity within the Atlantic Alliance and will accordingly continue its efforts to strengthen
institutional and practical cooperation with NATO.
10. In addition to its support for the common defence enshrined in Article 5 of the Washington
Treaty and Article V of the modified Brussels Treaty, WEU takes an active role in
conflict prevention and crisis management as provided for in the Petersberg Declaration.
In this context, WEU undertakes to perform its role to the full, respecting the full transparency
and complementarity between the two Organisations.
11. WEU affirms that this identity will be grounded on sound military principles and
supported by appropriate military planning and will permit the creation of militarily
coherent and effective forces capable of operating under the political control and strategic
direction of WEU.
12. To this end, WEU will develop its cooperation with NATO, in particular in the following
fields :
— mechanisms for consulution between WEU and NATO in the context of a crisis;
130 Final Act
— WEU's active involvement in the NATO defence planning process;
— operational links between WEU and NATO for the planning, preparation and conduct
of operations using NATO assets and capabilities under the political control and
strategic direction of WEU, including:
— military planning, conducted by NATO in coordination with WEU, and exercises;
— a framework agreement on the transfer, monitoring and return of NATO assets
and capabilities;
— liaison between WEU and NATO in the context of European command
arrangements.
This cooperation will continue to evolve, also uking account of the adapution of the
Alliance.
C. WEU's OPERATIONAL ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ESDI
13. WEU will develop its role as the European pohtico-military body for crisis management,
by using the assets and capabilities made available by WEU nations on a national or
multinational basis, and having recourse, when appropriate, to NATO's assets and
capabilities under arrangements being worked out. In this context, WEU will also support
the UN and OSCE in their crisis management tasks.
WEU will contribute, in the framework of Article J.7 of the Treaty on European Union,
to the progressive framing of a common defence policy and carry forward its concrete
implementation through the further development of its own operational role.
14. To this end, WEU will take forward work in the following fields:
. n ' . y
— WEU has developed crisis management mechanisms and procedures which will be
updated as WEU gains experience through exercises and operations. The implementation
of Petersberg missions calls for flexible modes of action geared to the diversity
of crisis situations and making optimum use of the available capabilities including
through recourse to national headquarters, which might be one provided by a
framework nation, or to multinational headquarters answerable to WEU or to NATO
assets and capabilities;
— WEU has already worked out Preliminary Conclusions on the Formulation of a
Common European Defence Policy which is an initial contribution on the objectives,
scope and means of a common European defence policy.
Treaty of Amsterdam 131
WEU will continue this work on the basis in particular of the Paris Declaration and
taking account of the relevant elements of the decisions of WEU and NATO summits
and ministerial meetings since Birmingham. It will focus on the following fields:
— definition of principles for the use of armed forces of the WEU States for WEU
Petersberg operations in pursuit of common European security interests;
— organisation of operational means for Petersberg tasks, such as generic and
contingency planning and exercising, preparation and interoperability of forces,
including through participation in the NATO defence planning process, as appropriate;
— strategic mobility on the basis of its current work;
— defence intelligence, through its Planning Cell, Situation Centre and Satellite
Centre;
WEU has adopted many measures to strengthen its operational role (Planning Cell,
Situation Centre, Satellite Centre). The improvement of the functioning of the military
components at WEU Headquarters and the esublishment, under the Council's
authority, of a military committee will represent a further enhancement of structures
which are important for the successful preparation and conduct of WEU operations;
with the aim of opening participation in all its operations to Associate Members and
Observer States, WEU will also examine the necessary modalities to allow Associate
Members and Observer Sutes to participate fully in accordance with their status in all
operations undertaken by WEU;
WEU recalls that Associate Members uke part on the same basis as full members in
operations to which they contribute, as well as in relevant exercises and planning.
WEU will also examine the question of participation of the Observers as fully as
possible in accordance with their sutus in planning and decision-taking within WEU
in all operations to which they contribute;
WEU will, in consulution where appropriate with the relevant bodies, examine the
possibilities for maximum participation in its activities by Associate Members and
Observer Sutes in accordance with their sutus. It will address in particular activities in
the fields of armaments, space and military studies;
WEU will examine how to strengthen the Associate Partners' participation in an
increasing number of activities.'

laying down minimum requirements for the protection of the safety and health of employees,
to discriminate in a manner unjustified by the circumstances against employees in small and
medium-sized undertakings.
27. Declaration on Article 118b(2) of the Treaty esublishing the European Community
The High Contracting Parties declare that the first of the arrangements for application of the
agreements between management and labour at Community level — referred to in
Article 118b(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community — will consist in
developing, by collective bargaining according to the rules of each Member State, the content
of the agreements, and that consequently this arrangement implies no obligation on the
Member States to apply the agreements direcdy or to work out rules for their transposition,
nor any obligation to amend national legislation in force to facilitate their implemenution.
28. Declaration on Article 119(4) of the Treaty esublishing the European Community
When adopting measures referred to in Article 119(4) of the Treaty esublishing the European
Community, Member States should, in the first insunce, aim at improving the situation of
women in working life.
29. Declaration on sport
The Conference emphasises the social significance of sport, in particular its role in forging
identity and bringing people together. The Conference therefore calls on the bodies of the
European Union to listen to sports associations when important questions affecting sport are
at issue. In this connection, special consideration should be given to the particular characteristics
of amateur sport. y
30. Declaration on island regions
The Conference recognises that island regions suffer from structural handicaps linked to their
island status, the permanence of which impairs their economic and social development.
The Conference accordingly acknowledges that Community legislation must take account of
these handicaps and that specific measures may be uken, where justified, in favour of these
regions in order to integrate them better into the internal market on fair conditions.
Treaty of Amsterdam 137
31. Declaration relating to the Council Decision of 13 July 1987
The Conference calls on the Commission to submit to the Council by the end of 1998 at the
latest a proposal to amend the Council decision of 13 July 1987 laying down the procedures
for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission.
32. Declaration on the organisation and functioning of the Commission
The Conference notes the Commission's intention to prepare a reorganization of tasks within
the college in good time for the Commission which will take up office in 2000, in order to
ensure an optimum division between conventional portfolios and specific tasks.
In this context, it considers that the President of the Commission must enjoy broad discretion
in the allocation of tasks within the college, as well as in any reshuffling of those tasks during
a Commission's term of office.
The Conference also notes the Commission's intention to undertake in parallel a corresponding
reorganisation of its departments. It notes in particular the desirability of bringing
external relations under the responsibility of a Vice-President.
33. Declaration on Article 188c(3) of the Treaty esublishing the European Community
The Conference invites the Court of Auditors, the European Investment Bank and the
Commission to mainuin in force the present Tripartite Agreement. If a succeeding or
amending text is required by any party, they shall endeavour to reach agreement on such a
text having regard to their respective interests.
34. Declaration on respect for time limits under the co-decision procedure
The Conference calls on the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to make
every effort to ensure that the co-decision procedure operates as expeditiously as possible. It
recalls the importance of strict respect for the deadlines set out in Article 189b of the Treaty
establishing the European Community and confirms that recourse, provided for in paragraph 7
of that Article, to extension of the periods in question should be considered only when strictly
necessary. In no case should the actual period between the second reading by the European
Parliament and the outcome of the Conciliation Committee exceed nine months.
35. Declaration on Article 191a(l) of the Treaty esublishing the European Community
The Conference agrees that the principles and conditions referred to in Article 191a(l) of the
Treaty esublishing the European Community will allow a Member State to request the
Commission or the Council not to communicate to third parties a document originating from
that Sute without its prior agreement.
138 Final Act
36. Declaration on the Overseas Countries sand Territories
The Conference recognises that the special arrangements for the association of the overseas
countries and territories (OCTs) under Part Four of the Treaty esublishing the European
Community were designed for countries and territories that were numerous, covered vast
areas and had large populations. The arrangements have changed litde since 1957.
The Conference notes that there are today only 20 OCTs and that they are extremely
scattered island territories with a toul population of approximately 900 000. Moreover, most
OCTs lag far behind in structural terms, a fact linked to their particularly severe geographical
and economic handicaps. In these circumstances, the special arrangements for association as
they were conceived in 1957 can no longer deal effectively with the challenges of OCT development.
The Conference solemnly resutes that the purpose of association is to promote the economic
and social development of the countries and territories and to esublish close economic
relations between them and the Community as a whole.
The Conference invites the Council, acting in accordance with the provisions of Article 136 of
the Treaty establishing the European Community, to review the association arrangements by
February 2000, with the fourfold objective of:
— promoting the economic and social development of the OCTs more effectively;
— developing economic relations between the OCTs and the European Union;
— taking greater account of the diversity and specific characteristics of the individual OCTs,
including aspects relating to freedom of esublishment;
— ensuring that the effectiveness of the financial instrument is improved.
37. Declaration on public credit institutions in Germany
y
The Conference notes the Commission's opinion to the effect that the Community's existing
competition rules allow services of general economic interest provided by public credit institutions
existing in Germany and the facilities granted to them to compensate for the costs
connected with such services to be uken into account in full. In this context, the way in which
Germany enables local authorities to carry out their usk of making available in their regions a
comprehensive and efficient financial infrastructure is a matter for the organisation of that
Member State. Such facilities may not adversely affect the conditions of competition to an
extent beyond that required in order to perform these particular usks and which is contrary to
the interests of the Community.
The Conference recalls that the European Council has invited the Commission to examine
whether similar cases exist in the other Member Sutes, to apply as appropriate the same
standards on similar cases and to inform the Council in its E C O F I N formation.
Treaty of Amsterdam 139
38. Declaration on voluntary service activities
The Conference recognises the important contribution made by voluntary service activities to
developing social solidarity.
The Community will encourage the European dimension of voluntary organisations with
particular emphasis on the exchange of information and experiences as well as on the participation
of the young and the elderly in voluntary work.
39. Declaration on the quality of the drafting of Community legislation
The Conference notes that the quality of the drafting of Community legislation is crucial if it
is to be properly implemented by the competent national authorities and better understood by
the public and in business circles. It recalls the conclusions on this subject reached by the
Presidency of the European Council in Edinburgh on 11 and 12 December 1992, as well as
the Council Resolution on the quality of drafting of Community legislation adopted on 8 June
1993 {Official Journal of the European Communities, C 166 of 17 June 1993, p. 1).
The Conference considers that the three institutions involved in the procedure for adopting
Community legislation, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, should lay
down guidelines on the quality of drafting of the said legislation. It also stresses that
Community legislation should be made more accessible and welcomes in this regard the
adoption and first implementation of an accelerated working method for official codification
of legislative texts, esublished by the Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994
(Official Journal of the European Communities, C 102 of 4 April 1996, p. 2).
Therefore, the Conference declares that the European Parliament, the Council and the
Commission ought to:
— establish by common accord guidelines for improving the quality of the drafting of
Community legislation and follow those guidelines when considering proposals for
Community legislation or draft legislation, taking the internal organisational measures they
deem necessary to ensure that these guidelines are properly applied;
— make their best efforts to accelerate the codification of legislative texts.
40. Declaration concerning the procedure for concluding international agreements by the
European Coal and Steel Community
The repeal of Article 14 of the Convention on the Transitional Provisions annexed to the
Treaty esublishing the European Coal and Steel Community does not alter existing practice
concerning the procedure for the conclusion of international agreements by the European
Coal and Steel Community.
140 Final Act
41. Declaration on the provisions relating to transparency, access to documents and the fight
against fraud
The Conference considers that the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission,
when they act in pursuance of the Treaty esublishing the European Coal and Steel
Community and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, should
draw guidance from the provisions relating to transparency, access to documents and the fight
against fraud in force within the framework of the Treaty esublishing the European
Community.
42. Declaration on the consolidation of the Treaties
The High Contracting Parties agreed that the technical work begun during the course of this
Intergovernmenul Conference shall continue as speedily as possible with the aim of drafting a
consolidation of all the relevant Treaties, including the Treaty on European Union.
They agreed that the final results of this technical work, which shall be made public for illustrative
purposes under the responsibility of the Secreury-General of the Council, shall have no
legal value.
43. Declaration relating to the Protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and
proportionality
The High Contracting Parties confirm, on the one hand, the Declaration on the implementation
of Community law annexed to the Final Act of the Treaty on European Union and, on
the other, the conclusions of the Essen European Council stating that the administrative
implementation of Community law shall in principle be the responsibility of the Member
Sutes in accordance with their constitutional arrangements. This shall not affect the supervisory,
monitoring and implementing powers of the Community Institutions as provided under
Articles 145 and 155 of the Treaty esubhshing the European Community.
44. Declaration on Article 2 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the
framework of the European Union
The High Contracting Parties agree that the Council shall adopt all the necessary measures
referred to in Article 2 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of
the European Union upon the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. To that
end, the necessary preparatory work shall be undertaken in due time in order to be completed
prior to that date.
45. Declaration on Article 4 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the
framework of the European Union
The High Contracting Parties invite the Council to seek the opinion of the Commission
before it decides on a request under Article 4 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis
into the framework of the European Union by Ireland or the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some or all of the provisions of the Schengen
acquis.
Treaty of Amsterdam 141
They also undertake to make their best efforts with a view to allowing Ireland or the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, if they so wish, to use the provisions of
Article 4 of the said Protocol so that the Council may be in a position to take the decisions
referred to in that Article upon the date of entry into force of that Protocol or at any time
thereafter.
46. Declaration on Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the
framework of the European Union
The High Contracting Parties undertake to make all efforts in order to make action among all
Member States possible in the domains of the Schengen acquis, in particular whenever Ireland
and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland have accepted some or all of
the provisions of that acquis in accordance with Article 4 of the Protocol integrating the
Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union.
47. Declaration on Article 6 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the
framework of the European Union
The High Contracting Parties agree to take all necessary steps so that the Agreements referred
to in Article 6 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the
European Union may enter into force on the same date as the date of entry into force of the
Treaty of Amsterdam.
48. Declaration relating to the Protocol on asylum for nationals of Member States of the
European Union
The Protocol on asylum for nationals of Member Sutes of the European Union does not
prejudice the right of each Member State to uke the organisational measures it deems
necessary to fulfil its obligations under the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the
status of refugees.
49. Declaration relating to subparagraph (d) of the Sole Article of the Protocol on asylum for
nationals of Member Sutes of the European Union
The Conference declares that, while recognising the importance of the Resolution of the
Ministers of the Member Sutes of the European Communities responsible for immigration of
30 November/1 December 1992 on manifestly unfounded applications for asylum and of the
Resolution of the Council of 20 June 1995 on minimum guarantees for asylum procedures, the
question of abuse of asylum procedures and appropriate rapid procedures to dispense with
manifestly unfounded applications for asylum should be further examined with a view to
introducing new improvements in order to accelerate these procedures.
142 Final Aa
50. Declaration relating to the Protocol on the institutions with the prospect of enlargement of
the European Union
Until the entry into force of the first enlargement it is agreed that the decision of the Council
of 29 March 1994 ('the Ioannina Compromise') will be extended and, by that date, a solution
for the special case of Spain will be found.
51. Declaration on Article 10 of the Treaty of Amsterdam
The Treaty of Amsterdam repeals and deletes lapsed provisions of the Treaty esublishing the
European Community, the Treaty esublishing the European Coal and Steel Community and
the Treaty esubUshing the European Atomic Energy Community as they were in force before
the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam and adapts certain of their provisions,
including the insertion of certain provisions of the Treaty esubUshing a single Council and a
single Commission of the European Communities and the Act concerning the election of the
representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage. Those operations do
not affect the 'acquis communautaire'.
Treaty of Amsterdam 143
DECLARATIONS OF WHICH THE CONFERENCE TOOK NOTE
1. Declaration by Austria and Luxembourg on credit institutions
Austria and Luxembourg consider that the Declaration on public credit institutions in
Germany also applies to credit institutions in Austria and Luxembourg with a comparable
organisational structure.
2. Declaration by Denmark on Article K.14 of the Treaty on European Union
Article K.14 of the Treaty on European Union requires the unanimity of all members of the
Council of the European Union, i.e. all Member Sutes, for the adoption of any decision to
apply the provisions of Title Ilia of the Treaty establishing the European Community on visas,
asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons to action in areas
referred to in Article K.l. Moreover, any unanimous decision of the Council, before coming
into force, will have to be adopted in each Member Sute, in accordance with its constitutional
requirements. In Denmark, such adoption will, in the case of a transfer of sovereignty, as
defined in the Danish constitution, require either a majority of five sixths of members of the
Folketing or both a majority of the members of the Folketing and a majority of voters in a
referendum.
3. Declaration by Germany, Austria and Belgium on subsidiarity
It is uken for granted by the German, Austrian and Belgian governments that action by the
European Community in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity not only concerns the
Member States but also their entities to the extent that they have their own law-making
powers conferred on them under national constitutional law.
4. Declaration by beland on Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom
and Ireland
Ireland declares that it intends to exercise its right under Article 3 of the Protocol on the
position of the United Kingdom and Ireland to uke part in the adoption of measures pursuant
to Title Ilia of the Treaty esublishing the European Community to the maximum extent
compatible with the maintenance of its Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom.
Ireland recalls that its participation in the Protocol on the application of certain aspects of
Article 7a of the Treaty esublishing the European Community reflects its wish to maintain its
Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom in order to maximise freedom of movement
into and out of Ireland.
144 Final Act
5. Declaration by Belgium on the Protocol on asylum for nationals of Member Sutes of the
European Union
In approving the Protocol on asylum for nationals of Member Sutes of the European Union,
Belgium declares that, in accordance with its obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention
and the 1967 New York Protocol, it shall, in accordance with the provision set out in
point (d) of the sole Article of that Protocol, carry out an individual examination of any
asylum request made by a national of another Member Sute.
6. Declaration by Belgium, France and Italy on the Protocol on the institutions with the
prospect of enlargement of the European Union
Belgium, France and Iuly observe that, on the basis of the results of the Intergovernmental
Conference, the Treaty of Amsterdam does not meet the need, reaffirmed at the Madrid
European Council, for substantial progress towards reinforcing the institutions.
Those countries consider that such reinforcement is an indispensable condition for the
conclusion of the first accession negotiations. They are determined to give the fullest effect
appropriate to the Protocol as regards the composition of the Commission and the weighting
of votes and consider that a significant extension of recourse to qualified majority voting,
forms part of the relevant factors which should be taken into account.
7. Declaration by France concerning the situation of the overseas departments in the light of
the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union
France considers that the implemenution of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into
the framework of the European Union does not affect the geographical scope of the
Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 signed in Schengen on
19 June 1990, as it is defined by Article 138, first paragraph, of that Convention.
8. Declaration by Greece concerning the Declaration on the status of churches and
non-confessional organisations
With reference to the Declaration on the sutus of churches and non-confessional organisations,
Greece recalls the Joint Declaration on Mount Athos annexed to the Final Act of the
Treaty of^Accession of Greece to the European Communities.
